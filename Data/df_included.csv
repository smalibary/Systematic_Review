A quantitative study for indoor workplace biophilic design to improve health and productivity performance,"Theoretical Framework for Productivity and Measurement

1. Dual Theoretical Frameworks: ART and SRT:

    The study's theoretical foundation is built on two main theories: Attention Restoration Theory (ART) and Stress Reduction Theory (SRT), which inform the expected effects of greenery on productivity.
        ART (Attention Restoration Theory): Suggests that exposure to nature has restorative effects on cognitive function, improving focus, attention, and information processing by allowing recovery from mental fatigue.
        SRT (Stress Reduction Theory): Posits that natural environments help reduce physiological stress and promote relaxation, thereby enhancing cognitive performance indirectly by reducing stress-related distractions and improving overall mood and mental clarity.
    Together, these theories propose that greenery in the workplace should enhance focused attention, relaxation, and cognitive processing, which are all vital components of productivity.

2. Translating Theory into Measurable Outcomes:

    The study uses the principles of ART and SRT to identify specific cognitive functions and physiological states that are likely to be influenced by exposure to greenery, guiding the selection of measures for productivity:
        ART-Based Measures: Since ART focuses on cognitive restoration, measures were selected to assess attention and cognitive performance directly. The Stroop Task (ST) was used to capture attention control and cognitive flexibility, while the Working Memory Task (WMT) gauged the capacity for information processing and memory retention.
        SRT-Based Measures: SRT's focus on stress reduction led to the use of physiological measures (HRV, EDA, EEG) to understand how greenery impacts relaxation and alertness, which can indirectly improve productivity by promoting a more focused state.

3. Specific Productivity Tests and Theoretical Links:

    The theoretical framework helped the study identify three key tasks to measure productivity, each chosen to represent different aspects of cognitive functioning influenced by ART and SRT:
        Visual Reaction Time Task (VRTT): Measures the speed of information processing and immediate attention, aligning with ART's emphasis on how exposure to nature can improve attentional functioning and quick response to stimuli.
        Stroop Task (ST): Evaluates the ability to handle cognitive interference and maintain selective attention, reflecting ART's focus on restored cognitive control and better mental flexibility. Improvements in ST performance indicate enhanced cognitive processing due to attention restoration from exposure to greenery.
        Working Memory Task (WMT): Captures the short-term memory and cognitive capacity, which are theorized to benefit from ART's proposed restorative effects on mental fatigue and focus.
    These productivity tests are designed to capture different stages of cognitive processing: VRTT for basic reaction and attention, ST for complex attentional control and cognitive flexibility, and WMT for information retention and processing.

4. Balancing ART and SRT Outcomes:

    The study aimed to connect productivity enhancements not just to psychological well-being (as proposed by ART) but also to physiological relaxation and stress reduction (as per SRT).
    By incorporating both cognitive tasks (reflecting ART outcomes) and physiological measures (reflecting SRT outcomes), the study achieves a holistic assessment of how greenery influences productivity through mental restoration and stress reduction.
    The results confirmed that greenery, especially at a 12% coverage ratio, led to faster cognitive processing (ST improvement) and enhanced relaxation (higher alpha EEG waves), in line with the combined effects predicted by ART and SRT.

Conclusion:

    The theoretical framework based on ART and SRT allowed for a multi-faceted approach to measure productivity. By using specific tests targeting attention restoration and stress reduction, the study successfully demonstrated how greenery exposure can directly improve various cognitive aspects of productivity and indirectly promote better performance by enhancing physiological relaxation. The integration of ART and SRT thus provided a robust foundation for understanding how nature exposure benefits worker productivity

Measuring Productivity through Multiple Tests

1. Comprehensive Productivity Measurement:

    The study seeks to understand how exposure to different greenery doses impacts productivity in an indoor workplace setting. Productivity is not one-dimensional; it encompasses multiple cognitive functions like attention, reaction speed, and working memory. Therefore, the researchers used three distinct tests to capture these different aspects of productivity:
        Visual Reaction Time Task (VRTT): Measures how quickly participants can react to a visual stimulus, indicating information processing efficiency.
        Stroop Task (ST): Evaluates cognitive control and attention by asking participants to read colored words, which requires both speed and accuracy in a cognitively challenging context.
        Working Memory Task (WMT): Assesses short-term memory capacity and complex cognitive processing through multi-step recall tasks, reflecting participants' ability to hold and manipulate information.

2. Rationale for Multiple Productivity Tests:

    Capturing Multiple Dimensions: By using three distinct tests, the study aims to assess different components of cognitive productivity, avoiding an overreliance on a single test that might only reflect one aspect of performance.
        VRTT focuses on reaction speed and processing efficiency, offering insight into how quickly participants can respond to stimuli in their environment.
        ST captures selective attention and mental flexibility under interference conditions, which is critical for real-world tasks that require both focus and adaptability.
        WMT reflects the ability to hold and process complex information, which is crucial for tasks that demand working memory and decision-making.
    Ensuring Robust Findings: A multifaceted approach provides a more holistic view of how greenery affects cognitive functioning and productivity. It allows for verification across different cognitive domains to validate the impact of biophilic design on overall productivity.

3. Integration of Test Results for a Holistic Understanding:

    The results from these three tests together help to create a comprehensive profile of productivity outcomes. For example:
        Stroop Task Improvement: The study found significant improvements in reading time, indicating that greenery helps participants focus and process information faster.
        No Significant Changes in VRTT and WMT: While the VRTT and WMT did not show large changes across green settings, their inclusion was still important for understanding that greenery's impact might be more pronounced in attention control and cognitive flexibility (measured by ST) than in simple reaction time or memory alone.
    By examining different cognitive skills, the study was able to identify that 12% greenery coverage specifically enhances productivity in ways relevant to workplace tasks that require focused attention and complex cognitive processing.

Conclusion:

    The use of multiple productivity measures (VRTT, ST, and WMT) is critical for understanding the broad effects of greenery exposure on cognitive performance. It provides a nuanced picture that confirms how certain levels of greenery can specifically enhance cognitive control and attention, key components of productivity in a work environment. This approach underscores that productivity is a multi-faceted construct and that biophilic design interventions have the potential to affect different dimensions of productivity in varied ways.

Establishing Causality over Correlation in Biophilic Design Effects

1. Clear Experimental Manipulation for Causality:

    The article's central goal is to establish causality in the effects of greenery on worker well-being and productivity.
    To achieve this, the researchers designed a controlled experiment, where they manipulated the independent variable (green coverage ratio) systematically across five different settings: 0% (baseline), 0.2%, 5%, 12%, and 20%. This controlled manipulation is crucial in moving beyond correlational data, as it allows for direct testing of how greenery levels affect outcomes.

2. Repeated-Measures Design for Robust Comparison:

    A repeated-measures design was used, meaning all 15 participants were exposed to every green coverage setting. This design helps establish causality by:
        Reducing variability: Each participant serves as their own control, ensuring that individual differences are not confounding the results.
        Direct comparison: Each greenery dose is compared directly against others, including the baseline condition with no greenery, allowing for a clearer view of the causal effects.
    The randomization of the order in which participants were exposed to the different settings helps prevent order effects, ensuring that the impact is due to the greenery dose and not the sequence of exposure.

3. Objective and Subjective Measures to Confirm Cause and Effect:

    The study uses a combination of objective physiological measures (e.g., HRV, EDA, EEG) and subjective psychological assessments (e.g., PRS questionnaire), along with productivity tasks (VRTT, Stroop Task, WMT). This multimodal approach allows for cross-validation of results, supporting that the changes in physiological relaxation, psychological restoration, and cognitive performance are direct effects of greenery exposure.
    Eye-tracking technology further confirms causality by showing that participants' visual attention was specifically directed at greenery, reinforcing that any observed changes in well-being or productivity are caused by visual contact with plants.

4. Verification through Baseline and Cross-Comparison:

    The inclusion of a baseline condition (0% greenery) provides a control to measure the impact of each greenery setting. Significant differences found between the baseline and green settings (especially the optimal 12% ratio) demonstrate that the outcomes are not coincidental.
    Statistical Analysis (ANOVA, Friedman Tests): The study uses statistical tests to determine the significance of differences across the greenery doses, ensuring that results are not due to random variation and reinforcing a causal relationship.

Conclusion:

    The systematic manipulation of greenery, use of repeated measures, and objective verification through physiological and productivity metrics effectively support causation rather than just correlation. The study concludes that a 12% green coverage ratio directly improves psychological well-being, relaxation, and productivity, confirming that the effects of biophilic design in the workplace are causally linked to the amount of greenery present.

Procedure of the Experiment and Timeframe

1. Setup and Environment:

    The experiment was a repeated-measures design, conducted over two weeks. Participants experienced five different office settings, each with varying green coverage ratios (0%, 0.2%, 5%, 12%, and 20%).
    Four physical office rooms were set up with real plants to represent different greenery doses, and one virtual environment using VR technology (HTC Vive) represented the highest dose (20% green coverage).

2. Participant Procedure:

    A total of 15 participants were exposed to each environment separately over two weeks.
    During Week 1, they visited the baseline (0% greenery) and two low-greenery environments (0.2% and 5% coverage).
    During Week 2, they revisited the baseline and then experienced the higher greenery environments (12% and 20% coverage).
    Participants had a 5-minute rest period in a neutral reception room between exposures to reset any physiological effects from the previous setting (validated to be effective).

3. Exposure Time and Task Duration:

    Each exposure to a greenery environment lasted 5 minutes, followed by a series of performance tasks and assessments.
    For each greenery dose, participants completed:
        Physiological Measures: 5 minutes of monitoring HRV, EDA, and EEG.
        Productivity Tasks: A 2-minute Visual Reaction Time Task (VRTT), a 3-minute Stroop Task (ST), and a 5-minute Working Memory Task (WMT).
        Psychological Assessment: A 5-minute Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS) questionnaire.
    Each visit took approximately 1.5 hours per participant per week.

4. Control and Randomization:

    The order of exposure to different greenery settings was randomized to mitigate order effects.
    Participants received instructions on the tasks before starting the first exposure to ensure familiarity with task rules and avoid learning effects.

5. Total Experiment Duration:

    Across both weeks, each participant spent around 3 hours in total in the experiment, with a careful balance between rest and exposure to ensure accurate data collection without participant fatigue.

This procedure ensures controlled, repeated exposure to different greenery doses, effectively allowing for cross-comparison of the effects of biophilic design on physiological, psychological, and productivity responses.

    A 12% green coverage ratio was identified as optimal for enhancing psychological well-being, physiological responses, and productivity in an office setting.
    Ratios of 0.2% and 5% were insufficient for restorative effects, while a 20% ratio was found to be overwhelming and did not produce additional benefits.

Psychological Responses:

    Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS) scores indicated that settings with 5% to 12% green coverage provided significant psychological benefits, such as reduced perceived distractions and a greater sense of compatibility and fascination.
    The 20% greenery setting led to negative psychological responses, with participants reporting increased feelings of distraction and chaos.

Productivity Performance:

    Stroop Task (a cognitive test) performance showed significant improvement in environments with greenery compared to the baseline (no greenery).
        Reading time was reduced in green-covered settings, particularly with a 654.2 ms decrease in the 12% coverage setting and a 914.53 ms decrease in the 20% setting.
    No significant differences were found in Visual Reaction Time Task (VRTT) and Working Memory Task (WMT) across the different greenery settings.

Physiological Responses:

    EEG Alpha Waves (indicative of relaxation and alertness) significantly increased in environments with 12% and 20% green coverage.
        Specifically, a 28.33 dB increase was observed in the 12% setting and a 94.91 dB increase in the 20% setting compared to the baseline.
    No significant differences were noted in Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Electrodermal Activity (EDA), suggesting the greenery may not influence physiological stress responses without a stressor present.

Eye-Tracking Verification:

    Total Fixation Duration (TFD) confirmed that visual attention was drawn to the greenery areas in all green-covered settings.
    However, TFD was not sensitive to the amount of vegetation (no significant differences among 0.2%, 5%, and 12% coverage), indicating that visual attention was consistently drawn to any green presence regardless of the amount.

Addressing psychosocial issues caused by the COVID-19 lockdown: Can urban greeneries help?,"Relationship Between Effect Size, Power, and Sample Size in Nature Therapy Studies
1. Situation:

The study comparing nature therapy and nature-exercise to reduce mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown had a small sample size (N = 30). Despite this, it achieved significant results due to the large effect size of the interventions on stress, anxiety, and depression outcomes. Researchers must understand how effect size impacts power and required participant numbers.
2. Problem or Question:

How does a large effect size (Cohen's d = 1.02) affect the relationship between statistical power (e.g., 85%, 90%) and sample size in intervention studies?
3. Responses to the Problem:

    Key Finding: With a large effect size like d=1.02d=1.02, the difference in participant numbers required for 85% vs. 90% power is minimal. For example:
        85% power required approximately 10–12 participants per group.
        90% power required 11 participants per group.
    Reason:
        Large effect sizes result in a steep power curve, meaning high power can be achieved with fewer participants.
        The increase in participant numbers as power rises is nonlinear and smaller for large effects compared to moderate or small effect sizes.
    Implication for Study Design:
        Researchers studying interventions with strong effects, such as nature exposure for mental health, can confidently plan smaller sample sizes while maintaining robust statistical power.
        This makes such interventions particularly suitable for pilot studies or research with logistical constraints (e.g., lockdowns).

4. Need:

Future research should:

    Investigate similar interventions with moderate or small effect sizes to examine how power changes sample size demands.
    Develop clear guidelines for estimating sample sizes in nature-based interventions across varying effect sizes.
    Emphasize the importance of effect size reporting to optimize study designs for real-world applications.

This idea underscores how understanding effect size can guide researchers in balancing study feasibility and statistical rigor.

Comparing the Effects of Nature Therapy vs. Nature Exercise on Mental Health During Lockdowns
1. Situation:

During the COVID-19 lockdown, mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression were exacerbated due to social isolation and restricted movement. Urban greeneries became accessible sanctuaries, offering opportunities for therapeutic interventions. This study investigates the effectiveness of nature therapy versus nature-exercise in alleviating these mental health challenges among young adults.
2. Problem or Question:

Which intervention-nature therapy or nature-exercise-is more effective in reducing mental health symptoms like stress, anxiety, and depression during prolonged lockdown periods?
3. Responses to the Problem:

    Nature Therapy:
        Focuses on sensory engagement and relaxation activities (e.g., observing nature, listening to birdsong, feeling flora).
        Showed higher overall effectiveness in reducing mental health symptoms:
            Stress: Reduced by 36.7% (12.13 ± 5.11 to 7.67 ± 3.48).
            Anxiety: Reduced by 30.7% (6.93 ± 2.94 to 4.8 ± 2.46).
            Depression: Reduced by 41.9% (7.8 ± 4.44 to 4.53 ± 2.85).
        Individual remission rates were significant, with all participants experiencing stress symptoms recovering fully (N = 4).

    Nature-Exercise:
        Combines physical workouts in natural settings (e.g., squats, planks, and jumping jacks) with exposure to urban greenery.
        Reduced symptoms but less effectively:
            Stress: Reduced by 14.2% (13.13 ± 3.96 to 11.27 ± 4.41).
            Anxiety: Reduced by 22.5% (6.8 ± 3.63 to 5.27 ± 3.6).
            Depression: Reduced by 16.9% (8.67 ± 4.53 to 7.2 ± 7.2).
        Individual remission rates were lower, with only 1 of 5 participants recovering fully from stress symptoms.

4. Need:

Future research should explore:

    Hybrid Approaches: Combining sensory-focused activities with mild physical exercises for potentially enhanced outcomes.
    Larger Sample Sizes: To validate findings and understand the differential mechanisms underlying nature therapy's superior efficacy.
    Occupational Contexts: Testing the interventions among remote workers or frontline employees for tailored workplace applications.

Assessing and Modelling the role of urban green spaces for human well-being in Lahore (Pakistan), Idea",https://chatgpt.com/g/g-MMN8j6CFo-systematic-reivew-gpt/c/6762b136-3d74-8003-8162-fd28daefa90c,"The study revealed several critical insights into the relationship between urban green spaces (UGSs) and human well-being. Below are the key findings, organized by dimensions of well-being and urban green space interaction:
1. Overall Impact of Urban Green Spaces on Well-being

    Positive Association: Urban green spaces significantly improve overall human well-being.
        Structural Model Result: Path coefficient (β = 0.904, R² = 0.817, p < 0.00) indicates a strong and statistically significant relationship.
    Key Factors: Frequent visits, spending more time, and closer proximity to green spaces enhance well-being outcomes.

2. Physical Well-being

    Increase in Physical Health:
        Regression results showed that well-being increases by 44.26 points for each level of frequent visits to green spaces.
        Spending more time in UGSs improves physical activity levels and reduces limitations caused by poor physical health.
    Proximity Matters: Closer green spaces (within 1-2 km) significantly enhance physical well-being compared to distant spaces.

3. Psychological Well-being

    Stress Reduction and Relaxation:
        Interaction with green spaces promotes psychological restoration and reduces stress and negative emotional states.
        Positive psychological effects were stronger for respondents with frequent and longer UGS visits.

4. Mental Well-being

    Reduced Stress and Anxiety:
        Respondents who interacted with UGSs reported lower levels of mental stress and anxiety.
        Spending more than 2-3 hours in green spaces acted as an “antidepressant” by improving mental health.

5. Social Well-being

    Improved Social Cohesion:
        UGSs served as platforms for social interaction, reducing feelings of isolation and improving social connectedness.
        Frequent visitors reported greater involvement in community activities and stronger social ties.

6. Subjective Well-being (Life Satisfaction)

    Happier Lives:
        Respondents living within 300 meters of green spaces reported higher levels of life satisfaction.
        Spending at least 2-3 hours daily in UGSs is associated with overall happiness and a positive mood.

7. Importance of Distance

    Well-being scores decrease as the distance from green spaces increases.
        For every 1-point increase in distance, there is a 23-point reduction in well-being.

8. Key Predictors of Well-being:

    Visiting Routine (Frequency): Daily visits contributed most to positive well-being outcomes.
    Time Spent in Green Spaces: Spending 2-3 hours was optimal for well-being improvements.
    Proximity: Green spaces within 1-5 km were more effective, with the strongest impact observed for those within 0.5-2 km.

9. Statistical Highlights

    Regression Models:
        Visiting Routine: R² = 0.526.
        Time Spent: R² = 0.652.
        Distance: R² = 0.291.
    SEM Findings:
        All well-being dimensions had outer loadings above 0.70, confirming a strong model fit.
        Physical well-being had the highest contribution (loading = 0.867), while subjective well-being contributed the least (loading = 0.789).

10. Limitations and Recommendations

    Key Limitation: Reliance on self-reported data may introduce bias.
    Policy Recommendations:
        Increase accessibility to green spaces within urban areas.
        Encourage daily visits to UGSs with programs promoting 2-3 hours of interaction.
        Design green spaces close to residential and workplace settings to maximize well-being outcomes.",During COVID,Pakistan,Survey,1050,Mixed,Mixed,NA,NA,Well being,Positive,Subjective,NA,"Urban Green Space Interaction (UGSI), Carol Ryff's Psychological Well-being scale, Carol Ryff's Psychological Well-being scale, Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), Keyes' 15-item Social Well-being scale, Diener's Life Satisfaction scale (5 items)",Observational (Quant),NA,0,"Frequency of Nature Visits, Time Spent in Green Spaces",NA,NA,Well being,Image

Attention and Emotion Recovery Effects of Urban Parks during COVID-19-Psychological Symptoms as Moderators,,https://chatgpt.com/g/g-MMN8j6CFo-systematic-reivew-gpt/c/6762adb3-35c0-8003-9e83-5d5fcd9427aa,"Restorative Benefits of Park Environments:

    All park environments (lawn, plaza, forest, waterside) significantly improved attention recovery (BDS scores) and emotional valence (positive mood) compared to green streets.
    The waterside environment was the most effective for emotional improvement, resulting in the highest increase in positive emotions among participants.

Green Streets Are Less Restorative:

    The green street environment did not provide significant recovery for attention and showed less emotional improvement compared to park environments.
    The presence of bottom-up stimuli in streets (e.g., traffic and advertisements) may consume cognitive resources, limiting recovery effects.

Emotional Arousal:

    Emotional arousal decreased over time in all environments, but no significant differences were found between the types of environments for this variable.

Depression Moderates Emotional Recovery:

    Participants with higher depressive symptoms showed reduced emotional recovery from natural environments, although their attention recovery was unaffected.
    This finding suggests that depressive symptoms may blunt the emotional restorative benefits of natural environments.

Stress Symptoms:

    Chronic stress levels (measured by the PSS-10) did not significantly influence the restorative benefits of any environment, possibly due to the self-reported nature of the stress measure.

Hardscapes Are Effective Too:

    Surprisingly, hardscape environments like plazas (with fewer natural elements) provided similar restorative benefits for attention and mood as natural settings (e.g., forests and watersides).",During COVID,China,Lab,125,Academia,Mixed,Artificial/Virtual,"Visual, Auditory","Attention, Emotional response, ",Positive or None,Mixed,Environmental Stimuli Presentation,"Backward Digit Span (BDS), Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)",Experimental (Quant),NA,10,"Type of environment, Time, Attention",Office (In Field),NA,Emotion & Mood,Image

    Both nearby nature and social connectedness independently improved subjective well-being (SWB) as measured by the WHO-5 Well-Being Index.
    Individuals with higher levels of social contact and greater access to nearby nature reported higher SWB scores.

Buffering Effect of Nearby Nature:

    Nearby nature moderated the relationship between social connectedness and SWB:
        For individuals with low social connectedness, high levels of nearby nature helped maintain higher SWB.
        This buffering effect was significant and reduced the likelihood of depression among socially isolated individuals.

Nature Visit Frequency Did Not Buffer SWB:

    Unlike nearby nature, frequent visits to natural areas did not show a significant buffering effect on the relationship between social connectedness and SWB.
    Instead, nature visits had additive effects: they improved SWB equally for individuals with both high and low social connectedness.

Clinical Implications:

    People with more nearby nature were less likely to report scores indicating a risk of depression, especially when social connectedness was low.

Nature's Importance Relative to Social Connectedness:

    The strength of association between nature exposure (especially nearby nature) and SWB was comparable to that of social connectedness, highlighting the importance of natural environments for mental health.

Practical Implications:

    Greener residential environments may act as a buffer against social isolation and support mental well-being.

    Support for Recovery: Natural sounds (e.g., rustling leaves, rippling water, birdsong) were perceived as calming and contributed to mental recovery by inducing ""soft fascination,"" a state of undemanding attention linked to stress reduction.
    Memory Stimulation: Participants reported that natural sounds evoked personal memories and associations, adding emotional value to the rehabilitation experience.
    Masking of Negative Sounds: Natural sounds, like water rippling, helped mask disruptive noises (e.g., motorway traffic), reducing their negative impact on participants.

2. Negative Impact of Technological Sounds:

    Disruptive Noise: Traffic noise from a nearby motorway (~0.6 km away) was a consistent source of annoyance for participants, interfering with relaxation and recovery.
    Variation in Perception: Sensitivity to motorway noise depended on participants' prior environments; those from quieter settings found it more intrusive.

3. Complex Role of Human Sounds:

    Early Disruption: Social sounds, such as loud conversations or uninvited interactions, were disruptive, particularly in the early stages of recovery when participants sought solitude.
    Therapists' Voices: Calm, slow-spoken voices of therapists were positively perceived and contributed to participants' sense of safety and tranquility.

4. Behavioral Choices Driven by Sound:

    Avoidance of Noisy Areas: Participants actively chose quieter zones within the garden to avoid disruptive sounds, particularly in areas closer to the motorway.
    Preference for Natural Soundscapes: Areas with natural sounds like water features were consistently favored.

5. Increased Sensitivity to Sound:

    Hyperacusis and Noise Sensitivity: Many participants reported heightened sensitivity to sounds during illness, including natural sounds (e.g., birdsong) in extreme cases. This sensitivity improved gradually during rehabilitation.
    Post-Therapy Effects: Some participants noted ongoing heightened awareness of sounds in everyday life, even after the program.

6. Multisensory Experience Enhances Recovery:

    Interplay of Senses: Participants frequently described how auditory experiences (e.g., natural sounds) interacted with visual, tactile, and olfactory inputs to create a more immersive restorative experience.

7. Design Implications:

    Natural features (e.g., water bodies, rustling vegetation) and walking materials (e.g., gravel, wooden paths) were instrumental in creating therapeutic soundscapes.

Conducting research in Radiation Oncology remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic: Coping with isolation,,,"Reduced Productivity and Feelings of Guilt:

    A significant proportion (71.2%) of the 543 radiation oncology researchers surveyed felt less productive while working from home during the pandemic.
    This perceived reduction in productivity led to feelings of guilt in 58% of participants.

Anxiety and Depression Levels:

    Among the 335 participants who completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire, 41% reported clinically relevant levels of anxiety, and 21% reported depressive symptoms.
    The mean anxiety score was 7.02, and the depression score was 5.02, which were higher than normative data from general European populations.

Impact of Support Systems:

    Support from institutional programs significantly influenced both anxiety and depressive symptoms. Participants with such support had lower anxiety and depression scores than those without support.
    The lack of contact (virtual or non-virtual) with colleagues or family/friends correlated with higher levels of depressive symptoms.

Home vs. On-Site Work:

    Participants working full-time on location (such as hospitals or labs) reported higher depressive symptoms compared to those working from home.
    There was a negative correlation between anxiety levels and years of research experience, indicating that more experienced researchers felt less anxious.

Perceived Impact of Isolation on Mental Health:

    67% of participants reported that social isolation negatively impacted their mental health.
    A minority (5%) felt that the isolation had a positive effect, possibly due to more time for self-care or family.

        Participants under strict lockdown (Level 1) reported significantly worse mental health outcomes:
            23.9% showed moderate to severe symptoms of depression and anxiety compared to 18.4% in Level 2 and 19.2% in Level 3.
            Severe restrictions were associated with higher psychological distress.

    Effect of Nature Exposure:
        Direct Exposure (access to outdoor spaces like gardens):
            Participants with gardens/patios were less likely to report symptoms of depression and anxiety compared to those with no access to outdoor spaces.
            Depression rates (PHQ-2 scores ≥ 3):
                19.7% for participants with gardens.
                31.9% for participants without outdoor spaces.
        Indirect Exposure (views of nature from windows):
            Participants with views of blue-green spaces (natural views) experienced fewer mental health challenges than those with urban or no views.
            Positive emotional states were more common in individuals with natural views.

    Psychological Resilience:
        Higher resilience scores were strongly linked to lower odds of depression and anxiety symptoms, emphasizing its protective role during lockdown.

    Demographic Moderators:
        Women and younger adults were more likely to experience depression and anxiety.
        Changes in employment status and lack of outdoor access further increased mental health risks.

    Perceived Coping:
        Participants perceived that access to outdoor spaces and natural views significantly helped them cope with lockdown measures.
        Gardens/patios provided the greatest psychological benefit, followed by balconies and shared/public spaces.

Correlation between Indoor Environmental Data and Biometric Parameters for the Impact Assessment of a Living Wall in a ZEB Lab,"Green View Factor (GVF) and Its Formation
Situation:

The study introduced the Green View Factor (GVF), a novel index quantifying the fraction of visible greenery from a specific point within an indoor environment. It was used to assess the impact of visual exposure to a living wall on participant comfort and environmental quality perceptions.
Problem or Question:

    Defining and Calculating GVF:
        How is the visible greenery quantified, and how does it relate to workspace design and participant responses?
        Are the GVF values (0.061 for P1 and 0.114 for P2) sufficient to induce measurable psychophysiological or perceptual effects?

Responses to the Problem:

    Formation of GVF:
        Visual Measurement: Fisheye images were taken from the participant's viewpoint (upper edge of the monitor).
        Calculation: The images were converted into black-and-white to isolate greenery coverage. The GVF was determined as the ratio of green pixels to the total pixels within a hemispherical field of view.
    Impact Assessment:
        GVF values indicate a low visible green area, but even small exposures have shown potential for psychological and physiological benefits.
        The study highlights GVF as a metric for comparing the effectiveness of greenery implementations across different studies and settings.
    Limitations:
        Low GVF values may not fully reflect the potential of larger-scale greenery exposure.
        GVF relies solely on visual exposure and does not consider other sensory interactions (e.g., smell, touch).

Need:

    Standardization:
        Develop a standardized methodology for calculating GVF to ensure consistency across studies.
    Expanded Scope:
        Investigate how variations in GVF (e.g., higher values or inclusion of peripheral vision) affect psychophysiological and productivity-related outcomes.
    Integration with Other Metrics:
        Combine GVF with factors like biometric responses, lighting, or air quality to create a holistic view of indoor greenery benefits.

The GVF serves as an innovative metric for quantifying visual greenery exposure and its potential impacts on workspace design. Its refinement and broader adoption could enhance workplace research and nature-based interventions.

Wearable Devices in Assessing Participant Responses
Situation:

The study used wearable devices to capture real-time biometric data, including skin temperature, electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate (HR), and motion (3-axis accelerometer). These wearables were integral to linking environmental conditions (e.g., relative humidity, VOC levels) with participants' physiological responses.
Problem or Question:

    Wearable Device Selection and Performance:
        The specific wearable models used were not disclosed, which limits replicability.
        Accuracy and sensitivity of the devices (e.g., EDA sensors) could affect the quality of data and subsequent analyses.
        Continuous data from wearables may introduce variability if calibration or participant compliance is inconsistent.

Responses to the Problem:

    Real-Time Monitoring:
        Wearables enabled continuous tracking of physiological changes, providing rich datasets for exploring correlations with environmental variables.
    Objective Data:
        They captured objective, quantifiable measures like EDA and skin temperature, which were crucial for linking stress and comfort to living wall configurations.
    Opportunities for Improvement:
        Standardized device models and consistent calibration procedures would enhance data reliability.
        Integration with validated biometric platforms (e.g., Empatica E4, Garmin, or Fitbit research devices) could improve accuracy and facilitate replication.

        Future studies should specify the wearable models used, their calibration procedures, and known limitations.
    Validation:
        Cross-verify wearable device data with additional measurement tools (e.g., stationary lab sensors for skin temperature or HR) to ensure accuracy.
    Usability:
        Incorporate participant feedback on wearability and comfort to avoid non-compliance or artifacts caused by discomfort.

Wearable devices provided essential insights into the psychophysiological impacts of nature exposure in workplace settings. Clearer reporting and validation would strengthen their utility in similar future research.
Correlation between Indoor Environmental Data and Biometric Parameters for the Impact Assessment of a Living Wall in a ZEB Lab, Idea

Limitation of Participant Number in the Study
Situation:

The study included only 9 participants, who alternated between two workstations during the experiment. Each participant's biometric and subjective responses were monitored under various configurations of a living wall and heat recovery system in a simulated office environment.
Problem or Question:

    Impact of Small Sample Size:
        The small number of participants may limit the generalizability of findings, as individual differences (e.g., age, gender, health status) could disproportionately influence the results.
        Statistical analyses and machine learning models might lack the robustness required for broader applicability to diverse office settings.

Responses to the Problem:

    Controlled Environment:
        The study mitigated variability by maintaining consistent experimental conditions and using the same participants across all configurations. However, this does not account for diverse real-world user profiles.
    Machine Learning Techniques:
        The use of advanced algorithms (e.g., XGBoost) partially compensates for the small dataset, but the accuracy may still be affected by overfitting due to limited input diversity.
    Future Directions:
        The results should be validated with a larger participant pool to ensure findings are applicable to varied demographic and psychophysiological profiles.

Need:

    Expand Sample Size:
        Conduct follow-up studies with at least 30–50 participants to enhance statistical power and representativity.
    Diversity:
        Include participants of varying ages, genders, and occupational backgrounds to better model real-world conditions.
    Cross-validation:
        Use additional trials to test the model's accuracy and generalizability across different groups.

This limitation highlights the importance of scaling up participant numbers in future research to build stronger evidence for the effects of living walls on worker well-being and productivity.

1. Environmental Impact of the Living Wall:

    Relative Humidity (RH):
        The presence of the living wall significantly increased RH, reaching up to 80% in configurations without the heat recovery (HR) system active.
        RH was the most dominant environmental variable influencing the plant configuration and participant comfort.
    VOC and CO2 Levels:
        The living wall impacted indoor air quality, particularly VOC concentrations, which were more influential than CO2 in correlating plant configurations with user responses.
    Temperature Variables:
        Air temperature (TA) and radiant temperature (TRA) had a smaller impact compared to RH and VOC on the environmental analysis.

2. Biometric Responses to Environmental Changes:

    Skin Temperature:
        A strong indicator of the participants' thermal comfort and physiological responses to different plant configurations.
    Electrodermal Activity (EDA):
        Reflected changes in stress or arousal levels caused by the environmental conditions, particularly RH and VOC levels.
    Heart Rate (HR):
        Contributed to understanding participants' psychophysiological state but was less dominant than other metrics.
    Motion:
        Minimal relevance for plant configuration assessment.

3. Machine Learning Results:

    Plant Configuration Identification:
        The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm achieved the highest accuracy in classifying plant configurations based on a combination of environmental and biometric data.
        Key Predictive Variables:
            Environmental: RH, VOC, CO2.
            Biometric: Skin temperature, EDA.
        Accuracy: ~99.8% with optimal feature selection.

4. Green View Factor (GVF):

    Introduced a new metric to quantify the amount of greenery visible from workstations.
    GVF values were low for both workstations (0.061 for P1 and 0.114 for P2), indicating a limited visible green area, though still impactful.

5. Impact on Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ):

    The living wall configurations improved perceived air quality and lighting satisfaction based on self-reported assessments.
    IEQ scores derived from user feedback correlated with objective environmental and biometric data, highlighting the potential for greenery to enhance workplace comfort.",Before COVID,Italy,"Field, Lab",9,NA,NA,Real,Visual,"Skin Temperature (Temp),Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Heart Rate (HR), Motion, Self-reported Performance, Thermo-hygrometric Wellness, Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) Score",Positive,Mixed,"Thermo-Hygrometer, Anemometer, CO2 Sensor, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) Sensor, Luxmeter, Black Globe Thermometer, Wearable Devices",NA,Experimental (Quant),Direct,300,"Environmental Factors, Time of Day, Plant Configuration",Office (In Field),Performance,Well being,Image

Different types of virtual natural environments enhance subjective vitality through restorativeness,"The Impact of Virtual Nature on Subjective Vitality

1. Situation:
Subjective vitality refers to the positive feeling of aliveness and energy, contributing to overall psychological well-being. It plays a crucial role in motivation, mental health, and coping strategies, making it an essential variable in well-being studies. This study explores how different virtual nature environments (a national park, lacustrine, and arctic) affect subjective vitality compared to an urban virtual environment.

2. Problem/Question:
The study addresses whether exposure to virtual nature can enhance subjective vitality through restorativeness. Given that vitality is linked to high activation of positive emotions and motivation, the study aims to find if virtual experiences can serve as a tool to boost well-being, particularly when real nature exposure is not possible.

3. Responses to the Problem/Question:

    The study found that all three virtual natural environments significantly enhanced subjective vitality compared to an urban virtual environment.
    The arctic environment had the highest impact, with an indirect effect on subjective vitality of 1.10 (BootSE = 0.23, 95% BootCI = [0.66, 1.56]).
    Subjective vitality scores were notably higher post-exposure to virtual nature, with the lacustrine condition achieving the highest average score (M = 4.33, SD = 1.04) compared to the urban setting (M = 3.85, SD = 1.13).
    Restorativeness mediated the relationship between virtual nature exposure and subjective vitality, confirming that the more restorative the environment felt, the greater the increase in vitality.

4. Need:
The findings indicate that virtual nature could be used as an intervention to improve subjective vitality, especially in contexts where access to real nature is limited (e.g., indoor workspaces, urban settings, or healthcare facilities). Further research should explore the long-term effects and optimal durations for such virtual nature interventions to sustain enhanced vitality.

        Park Condition: M = 4.05, SD = 1.13.
        Lacustrine Condition: M = 4.33, SD = 1.04.
        Arctic Condition: M = 4.19, SD = 0.84.
        Subjective vitality was higher in natural conditions compared to the urban condition, with the lacustrine condition showing the highest vitality.

    Mediation Effects (Indirect Effects through Restorativeness):
        Park Condition: Indirect effect on subjective vitality was 0.78, Bootstrapped Standard Error (BootSE) = 0.22, with a 95% Bootstrapped Confidence Interval (BootCI) of [0.38, 1.25].
        Lacustrine Condition: Indirect effect was 0.87, BootSE = 0.21, 95% BootCI = [0.49, 1.30].
        Arctic Condition: Indirect effect was 1.10, BootSE = 0.23, 95% BootCI = [0.66, 1.56].
        These results indicate all the natural conditions had a significant positive indirect effect on subjective vitality through restorativeness, with the arctic condition having the highest effect.

    Significance of Restorativeness as a Mediator (Path b):
        The effect of restorativeness on subjective vitality was significant, indicating that as restorativeness increased, subjective vitality also increased across all natural conditions.

    Statistical Variance Explained:
        Restorativeness Model: Explained 40% of the variance (R² = 0.40, F = 24.03, p < .001).
        Subjective Vitality Model: Explained 27% of the variance (R² = 0.27, F = 10.07, p < .001).

Effects of a sensory garden on workplace wellbeing: A randomised control trial,"Exploring Work-Performance Variables – Input and Output Dimensions
1. Key Dimensions of Work-Performance Variables

Work performance can be categorized into input-related variables (factors affecting effort and resources put into work) and output-related variables (results or outcomes achieved).
Input-Related Variables:

    Effort:
        The amount of physical, cognitive, and emotional energy employees invest in their tasks.
        Often tracked through time spent on tasks or self-reports about perceived effort.

    Engagement:
        A measure of how focused, enthusiastic, and mentally involved employees are.
        Tools like the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) assess this.

    Resource Utilization:
        Efficiency in using time, equipment, and organizational support to achieve goals.

    Workload:
        Perceived or actual demands of a job, such as task complexity, volume, and time pressure. Measured using tools like the NASA Task Load Index.

    Training and Skills:
        Employee competence levels, based on training, education, and job-specific skills.

Output-Related Variables:

    Productivity (Perceived Work Output):
        Defined as the results achieved per unit of effort (e.g., completed projects, sales figures).
        In the study, it was assessed through the WHO Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ).

    Quality of Work:
        Accuracy and standard of completed tasks. It can be quantified through error rates, client feedback, or supervisor reviews.

    Innovation and Creativity:
        The ability to generate new ideas or solve problems. Commonly measured through brainstorming productivity or problem-solving tasks.

    Task Completion Rates:
        A direct measure of how efficiently employees meet deadlines or deliverables.

    Absenteeism and Presenteeism:
        Absenteeism: Days missed due to illness or other reasons.
        Presenteeism: Reduced productivity while at work due to physical or mental health issues.

2. Connection Between Input and Output Variables:

    Input variables like engagement, workload, and skills directly influence output variables like productivity, quality, and task completion. For example:
        A high level of engagement and manageable workload often lead to increased productivity and higher-quality output.
        Conversely, heavy workload or lack of resources may reduce both efficiency (output) and employee wellbeing.

3. Work-Performance in the Context of Nature Exposure:

    Input Impact: Nature exposure can boost engagement and reduce workload perception by lowering stress (16% reduction in cortisol in the sensory garden group).
    Output Impact: This leads to higher productivity (+2.8% improvement in perceived work output) and potentially better task quality due to improved focus and wellbeing.

4. Future Research Directions:

    Investigate how other nature-related interventions (e.g., biophilic office designs, nature sounds) impact both input (effort, engagement) and output (productivity, quality) variables.
    Explore relationships between cognitive performance (input) and creative problem-solving (output) as mediators of work performance in restorative environments.

Other Work-Related Variables

    Variables Related to Productivity in Workplace Psychology:
        Job Satisfaction:
            Reflects how content workers are with their job role, environment, and compensation.
            Typically assessed with surveys or Likert-scale questionnaires.
        Work Engagement:
            Measures the level of enthusiasm, absorption, and commitment employees have toward their work. Assessed through tools like the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES).
        Work Stress:
            Evaluates perceived job-related stress due to workload, management style, or workplace environment. Commonly measured using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).
        Burnout:
            Refers to chronic workplace stress, characterized by emotional exhaustion and reduced personal accomplishment. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) is often used.
        Workplace Wellbeing:
            Examines overall employee health, happiness, and satisfaction. Tools like the Flourishing Scale or bespoke surveys are popular.
        Presenteeism and Absenteeism:
            These measure the extent to which employees are physically or mentally unwell but still at work (presenteeism) or completely absent from work (absenteeism).
        Cognitive Performance:
            Encompasses memory, focus, and decision-making abilities during tasks, often tested using psychometric tools or cognitive batteries.

Understanding Productivity and Perceived Work Output

    Definition: Productivity, in this study, refers to perceived work output, which is how participants evaluated their own efficiency and performance during work tasks.
    Assessment Used: Productivity was measured using an adaptation of the World Health Organization's Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ). It included questions on absenteeism (time missed from work) and presenteeism (reduced performance while at work).
    Key Finding: Exposure to the sensory garden increased perceived work output by 2.8% compared to the control group, indicating that nature exposure may improve workplace efficiency.
    Note for PhD Researchers: When assessing productivity, incorporating both objective measures (e.g., task completion time, error rates) and subjective self-reports (e.g., questionnaires) can provide a more comprehensive understanding.

    Participants in the sensory garden (SG) group experienced a 16.1% reduction in salivary cortisol levels compared to the control group.
    This reduction was significantly greater than typical results from other greenspace studies, which average a 5% reduction in cortisol.

Improved Wellbeing:

    The SG group reported a 6.9% improvement in perceived wellbeing (measured using the Flourishing Scale) compared to the control group. This was a statistically significant increase.
    In contrast, participants in the urban plaza (UP) group showed a 4% decline in wellbeing compared to the SG group, though this was not statistically significant.

Enhanced Productivity:

    The SG group exhibited a 2.8% increase in perceived work output (productivity) compared to the control group. This was statistically significant.
    The UP group showed a 2% decline in productivity compared to the SG group.

Nature Relatedness:

    Participants in the SG group displayed an increase in nature relatedness, suggesting that exposure to a biodiverse environment strengthened their connection to nature.

Comparison of Spaces:

    The sensory garden, with its biodiversity (210 plant species and numerous animal visitors), was more effective at reducing stress and improving wellbeing and productivity than the urban plaza, which had limited greenery (8 plant species).
    The urban plaza group exhibited trends toward negative effects on wellbeing and productivity.

Visits to Greenspaces:

    Participants who experienced the sensory garden were more likely to seek out nature in their personal time, while those in the urban plaza reduced visits to greenspaces.

Efficacy of nature-based therapy for individuals with stress-related illnesses: randomised controlled trial,"Long-Term Benefits of Nature-Based Therapy (NBT) for Stress-Related Illnesses
1. Sustained Psychological Well-Being Improvements:

    Participants in Nacadia Nature-Based Therapy (NNBT) maintained significant gains in psychological well-being for up to 12 months post-treatment, demonstrating the therapy's long-term efficacy.
    Key Data:
        PGWBI scores for NNBT increased from 46.6 at baseline to 63.5 at 12 months (p < 0.001).
        These scores closely approached the average well-being levels of healthy Danish individuals (mean: 73.14, as reported by MAPI Institute).
    Significance: Sustained benefits suggest NBT helps rebuild lasting resilience against stress rather than offering short-term symptom relief.

2. Prolonged Burnout Reduction:

    Burnout levels, as measured by the Shirom–Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ), remained significantly lower in the NNBT group even one year after the intervention.
    Impact: Lower burnout rates indicate improved ability to manage physical fatigue, cognitive weariness, tension, and listlessness, essential for long-term mental health and workplace productivity.

3. Holistic and Multisensory Nature Exposure:

    Real-nature exposure (e.g., gardening, mindfulness in a therapeutic forest setting) created a restorative environment that contributed to long-term cognitive and emotional recovery.
    Mechanism: Multisensory engagement (visual, auditory, tactile) in a natural setting may have reconditioned participants' stress response systems, promoting sustained health benefits.

Environmental effects on cognition and decision making of knowledge workers,"Knowledge workers are professionals whose primary job involves handling or using information to solve problems, create knowledge, and make decisions. These workers rely on cognitive skills, expertise, and creativity rather than physical labor to perform their tasks. The term was popularized by management theorist Peter Drucker in 1959.
Key Characteristics of Knowledge Workers:

    Cognitive Focus:
        Their work often revolves around thinking, analyzing, strategizing, or decision-making.
        They handle complex information and apply specialized knowledge.

    Tools and Resources:
        Use digital tools like laptops, software, and cloud-based platforms to collaborate and create.
        Depend on access to data and communication networks (e.g., the internet).

    Autonomy:
        Knowledge workers often have a high degree of independence in how they approach tasks and solve problems.

    Output:
        Their productivity is measured not by the number of tangible units produced but by the quality of their insights, solutions, or innovations.

Examples of Knowledge Workers:

    Software developers
    Researchers
    Engineers
    Educators
    Scientists
    Financial analysts
    Lawyers
    Designers
    Consultants

Importance in Modern Workplaces:

        It showed some association with lower stress in Survey 1 but became non-significant in later surveys (Survey 2 and Survey 3).
        Subgroups with higher indoor nature exposure did show benefits, but these effects were less pronounced compared to outdoor exposure.

Stress Decreased Over Time:

    Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores reduced over the study period:
        Mean PSS decreased from 17 in Survey 1 to 16 in Survey 2 and 3, suggesting that stress levels eased as pandemic restrictions lifted and participants adapted.

Latent Subgroups of Nature Exposure:

    The study identified latent subgroups (profiles) of participants based on their exposure to nature:
        In Survey 1, five profiles were identified, ranging from low exposure to both indoor and outdoor nature to high outdoor exposure.
        Over time, the number of profiles decreased to four in Survey 2 and three in Survey 3, reflecting a convergence in participants' nature exposure patterns.
    High outdoor exposure subgroups had significantly lower stress than subgroups with low or medium exposure.

Dynamic Patterns in Nature Exposure:

    Time spent in outdoor nature remained relatively stable over the study (average 4–5 hours per week).
    However, indoor nature exposure decreased significantly:
        Participants reported having fewer natural elements (e.g., plants, natural light) in their home offices over time.

Profile-Specific Insights:

    Certain subgroups (e.g., Profile 4 in Survey 2) demonstrated stronger associations between nature exposure (indoor and outdoor) and stress reduction, indicating that some individuals benefit more from specific types of nature exposure.",During COVID,United States,Survey,603,NA,Mixed,NA,NA,Stress,Positive,Subjective,NA,"Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Latent Profile Analysis (LPA)",Observational (Quant),NA,0,Nature Exposure,Remote,NA,Stress,Image
Exploring the relationship between home environmental characteristics and restorative effect through neural activities,"the Influence of Nature Exposure in Home Environments on Mental Restoration:

1. Situation:
The study explores how different home environmental characteristics impact restorativeness and neural activity in individuals. Specifically, it examines how exposure to elements like window views, room size, and warm colors affect mental restoration when these features simulate natural environments. The research uses VR technology to simulate these spaces, analyzing neural and physiological responses.

2. Problem or Question:
How do specific home characteristics related to nature exposure (e.g., window views, greenness, access to outdoor spaces) predict the restorative potential of a residential environment, and can they be objectively measured through neural activity?

3. Responses to the Problem or Question:

    The study finds that overall window views, warm colors, room size, and access to outdoor spaces significantly enhance restorative potential. These characteristics mimic nature exposure within the home.
    Neural activity recorded through the Neu-VR system indicates that environments with greater restorative potential resulted in:
        Reduced pupil size (mean difference of 0.31 mm), indicating lower cognitive load and possibly greater relaxation.
        Lower attention shift frequency (difference of 1.60 shifts per second), suggesting a more captivating and less distracting environment.
        These measures provide objective data indicating that certain features associated with nature exposure in the home environment lead to mental restoration and improved well-being.

4. Need or New Approach: For future research or interventions:

    Implementing natural elements in home design (like windows overlooking greenery, larger room sizes, and access to outdoor spaces) can be a way to improve worker mental health and productivity, especially for those working remotely.
    Further development of VR-based assessments could refine the understanding of how nature exposure influences neural activity, allowing better personalization of spaces for mental health benefits.

    Four main home characteristics were identified as significant predictors of restorative potential: overall window view, warm colors, room size, and access to outdoor space.
    The regression model showed a high confidence interval with p < 0.001 and an R² = 0.843 (F = 18.397).
        The overall window view had a beta of 0.311 (p = 0.023).
        Warm colors showed a beta of 0.221 (p = 0.029).
        Room size had a beta of 0.297 (p = 0.010).
        Access to outdoor space showed the strongest association with a beta of 0.579 (p < 0.001)​.

Neural Activity Data via Neu-VR:

    The VR simulation compared environments with high (O) and low (X) restorative potential scores, with these specific measurements:
        Pupil Radius: Mean pupil radius was 1.82 mm ± 0.17 for the high restorative environment (O) and 2.13 mm ± 0.21 for the low restorative environment (X).
            The difference of 0.31 mm was statistically significant (p < 0.001).
        Attention Shift Frequency: Mean attention shifts were 9.26 shifts per second (± 2.25) for environment O and 10.86 shifts per second (± 2.65) for environment X.
            The difference of 1.60 shifts per second was statistically significant (p = 0.01).
        Blink Frequency: There was a significant difference in blink frequency (p = 0.01), with a mean of 26.76 blinks per minute for environment O and 40.16 blinks per minute for environment X.
        Cerebral Hemoglobin Density: Statistically significant differences were found at the R3 position (p = 0.04), but no significant differences were observed at positions L1, L3, and R1​.

Restorative Potential Correlation:

    A zero-order correlation analysis showed that certain environmental features were significantly correlated with restorative potential:
        Overall window view (r = 0.72), sky view (r = 0.58), window size (r = 0.41), greenness (r = 0.37), warm colors (r = 0.35), room size (r = 0.56), and access to outdoor space (r = 0.81) were significantly related to perceived restorative potential (p < 0.05 for all).

Comparison of Gaze Heatmaps:

    Heatmaps of participants' gaze positions revealed that in the environment with low restorative potential (X), gaze was dispersed and often focused on metal frames and textual artwork.
    In the environment with high restorative potential (O), gaze was more centralized, focusing on window views and artwork, aligning with the restorative quality of seascapes and artworks as previously reported in literature.",During COVID,China,Lab,81,Academia,Mixed,Artificial/Virtual,Visual,Restoration,Positive,Mixed,Neu-VR technology,Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS-11),Experimental (Quant),Indirect,3,Characteristics of the home environment,NA,NA,Restoration,Image

    Gardeners reported significantly better perceived general health, fewer subjective health complaints, improved mental health, and greater social cohesion compared to non-gardeners.
    However, there was no significant difference in BMI between gardeners and non-gardeners.

Statistical Results

    Perceived General Health: Positive effect of gardening participation (β = 1.40, p < 0.001).
    Subjective Health Complaints: Negative effect (β = −0.43, p < 0.05), meaning fewer complaints among gardeners.
    Mental Health: Negative effect (β = −0.91, p < 0.05), meaning better mental health for gardeners.
    Social Cohesion: Positive effect (β = 1.57, p < 0.001).

Gardening Frequency and Duration

    Neither frequency nor duration of gardening had a significant impact on the measured health outcomes. This suggests that even infrequent and short-duration gardening can yield health benefits.

Gender and Lifestyle Factors

    Male gardeners reported better health outcomes than female gardeners, though gender differences were less pronounced in mental health.
    Vegetable intake frequency was significantly higher among gardeners, contributing to healthier diets.

Mechanisms of Health Benefits

    Gardening provides direct exposure to nature, which supports mental health through mechanisms like attention restoration and stress reduction.
    It involves moderate physical activity, contributing to physical and psychological health.
    Encourages social interaction and promotes community bonds, improving social cohesion.

Broader Implications

    The findings emphasize the potential of urban greenspaces like allotment gardens as low-cost tools for public health promotion.
    Benefits of gardening were observed even in highly urbanized settings like Tokyo, where access to nature is limited.

Having a home garden reduced the DASS-21 mental distress scores more effectively than other forms of urban green infrastructure (coefficient of -5.2).

Females showed higher mental distress compared to males during the pandemic, with gender having a greater effect on mental distress (model coefficient of -6.9) than any green infrastructure variable. Given that 77% of the study's participants were female, the distress levels were particularly high, highlighting the need for gender-focused support strategies.

Despite proximity to parks (average 2 km away), 41% of participants never visited parks and 28% rarely visited them during the pandemic. This low engagement is possibly due to self-isolation behaviors and fear of contagion.

Viewing green areas from windows and engaging in gardening activities had smaller effects on reducing distress (coefficients of -0.7 and -0.5, respectively) compared to having a home garden.

Honold et al. - 2016 - Restoration in Urban Spaces Nature Views From Hom,"Types of Nature Exposure and Their Implications for Health
1. Passive Nature Exposure

    Definition: Involves indirect interaction, such as viewing vegetation from windows at home.
    Details:
        Participants in the study experienced daily exposure to real, visible vegetation from their homes.
        Vegetation quantity (percentage of greenery) and diversity (types of plants) were analyzed.
    Impact:
        High vegetation diversity and quantity in window views were linked to lower cortisol levels, indicating reduced stress.
        Suggests passive exposure can have measurable physiological benefits over time.

2. Active Nature Exposure

    Definition: Involves direct interaction, such as physical visits to urban green spaces.
    Details:
        Participants frequently visited green spaces like a vegetated canal trail or parks.
        Activities included walking, socializing, commuting, or exercising.
    Impact:
        Frequent use of the vegetated trail was associated with lower cortisol levels and higher life satisfaction.
        Highlights the importance of active engagement with natural environments for both physiological and psychological health.

3. Research Implications

    Combining passive (views) and active (visits) exposures provides a holistic understanding of how urban nature supports health.
    Suggests urban planners and workplace designers should incorporate both accessible green spaces and views of greenery for maximum restorative benefits.

This distinction between passive and active exposure offers a practical framework for evaluating and optimizing the role of nature in improving mental health and productivity.

    Lower Stress Levels:
        Participants with views of high vegetation diversity and quantity from their homes had significantly lower hair cortisol levels, indicating reduced chronic stress.
        Interaction Effect: Both high diversity and high quantity were necessary to achieve the lowest cortisol levels.
        Unexpected Finding: Views with high vegetation quantity but low diversity were associated with higher cortisol levels, possibly due to factors like obstructed light.

2. Impact of Active Exposure to Nature (Use of Green Spaces)

    Cortisol Reduction:
        Frequent users (at least weekly) of the vegetated trail along the canal exhibited significantly lower cortisol levels than infrequent users.
        Frequent use of Görlitzer Park also showed reduced cortisol levels, though the effects were less robust.
    Increased Life Satisfaction:
        Participants who frequently used the canal trail reported significantly higher life satisfaction compared to less frequent users.
        Görlitzer Park usage had no significant effect on life satisfaction, possibly due to its mixed purpose (social and recreational).

3. Role of Vegetated Trails Over Parks

    Vegetated linear trails (e.g., canal trail) were perceived as more restorative and accessible than traditional parks.
    Greenways with vegetated paths were often used for leisure, commuting, and short breaks, making them an integral part of daily life.

4. Urban Green Space Accessibility

    Accessibility and connectivity were crucial:
        Participants avoided some parks (e.g., Treptower Park) due to inconvenient access or unattractive routes, despite their aesthetic appeal.
        This suggests that proximity and ease of access are critical for promoting regular use and associated health benefits.

5. Disconnection Between Subjective and Objective Indicators

    Cortisol levels (objective measure) were consistently linked with exposure to nature, while subjective health indicators (life satisfaction and general health) showed weaker associations.
    This indicates the need for multi-dimensional approaches when assessing the health impacts of nature exposure.

6. Influence of Demographics and Lifestyle

    Factors like age, exercise, and residential choice influenced the results but did not fully account for the observed health benefits from nature exposure.
    Self-selection (choosing homes with better views) did not strongly bias the findings, as green space use and health outcomes were independently significant.

Hyvönen et al. - 2018 - Profiles of nature exposure and outdoor activities,"Spectrum of Nature Exposure Profiles as a Continuum of Well-Being Potential

Situation: Employee interactions with nature do not follow a binary pattern of ""exposed"" versus ""not exposed."" Instead, there exists a spectrum of engagement, which offers a nuanced understanding of how nature exposure impacts occupational well-being.

Problem/Question: How can a continuum of nature exposure profiles reveal incremental changes in well-being outcomes, and how can these insights guide workplace interventions?

Response: The study identifies five profiles, representing a spectrum from High Exposure (most beneficial) to Low Exposure (least beneficial). These profiles highlight a progressive relationship between the degree of exposure/activity and well-being:

    High Exposure: Frequent interactions with nature during both work and leisure. Outcomes: Highest vigor (+0.63), dedication (+0.71), and lowest burnout in cynicism (-0.47).
    Versatile Exposure: High leisure exposure with diverse activities. Outcomes: High engagement (e.g., dedication +0.44), but no additional benefits from activity diversity.
    Unilateral Exposure: High leisure exposure with limited activities (e.g., walking, enjoying nature). Outcomes: Moderately positive well-being, showing frequency outweighs diversity.
    Average Exposure: Moderate exposure across settings. Outcomes: Average well-being, with slightly higher dedication than Low Exposure.
    Low Exposure: Infrequent exposure during work and leisure. Outcomes: Lowest engagement (dedication -0.71 compared to High Exposure) and highest burnout.

Key Insight: The spectrum suggests that incremental increases in nature exposure (e.g., moving from Low to Average or Unilateral) can yield measurable improvements in employee well-being.

Need: This spectrum model can inform workplace policies aiming to ""upgrade"" employees' exposure levels through simple measures:

    Encouraging short nature breaks at work.
    Providing flexible schedules for leisure engagement with nature.
    Creating access to natural elements like green spaces or window views to shift individuals along the spectrum toward more favorable profiles.

By viewing nature exposure as a continuum, organizations can target small, actionable changes that aggregate into meaningful well-being gains.

Profiles of Nature Exposure as Predictors of Work Engagement and Burnout

Situation: Employees interact with nature at varying levels and frequencies during work and leisure. This variation can impact their occupational well-being.
Problem/Question: How can distinct patterns of nature exposure and activities be systematically linked to employee well-being outcomes like work engagement and burnout?
Response: Using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA), five distinct profiles were identified based on frequency and diversity of nature exposure and outdoor activities: High Exposure, Versatile Exposure, Unilateral Exposure, Average Exposure, and Low Exposure.

    Key Findings:
        High exposure is strongly linked to greater vigor (+0.63) and dedication (+0.71) at work, along with reduced burnout in cynicism (-0.47) and professional inadequacy (-0.40).
        Low exposure correlates with poorer outcomes in work engagement and higher burnout.
        Need: Further exploration of how tailored workplace interventions (e.g., integrating natural spaces in offices or encouraging nature breaks) can shift individuals into more favorable exposure profiles to enhance well-being.
Hyvönen et al. - 2018 - Profiles of nature exposure and outdoor activities, Idea

Activity Diversity and Its Role in Employee Well-Being

Situation: The types of activities employees engage in during nature exposure may influence the psychological benefits they receive.
Problem/Question: Does the diversity of outdoor activities in nature make a difference in well-being outcomes, or is frequency alone sufficient?
Response: The study highlights a contrast between two profiles with frequent exposure:

    Versatile Exposure Profile: Participants engage in varied activities like walking, jogging, gardening, picking berries, and boating.
    Unilateral Exposure Profile: Participants stick to fewer activities, primarily walking or enjoying nature.
    While both profiles reported higher work engagement compared to low exposure, diversity of activities did not significantly enhance outcomes.
    Need: Research into whether specific types of activities (e.g., physical, meditative) have unique restorative benefits could guide tailored interventions in workplace well-being programs.
Hyvönen et al. - 2018 - Profiles of nature exposure and outdoor activities, Idea

Nature Exposure at Work as a Unique Profile Feature

Situation: Employees who experience nature at work may differ in occupational well-being compared to those exposed only during leisure.
Problem/Question: How does workplace nature exposure uniquely contribute to employee well-being, and what can be done to enhance its benefits?
Response: The High Exposure Profile, which includes frequent nature exposure at work, demonstrated the most positive well-being outcomes. Employees in this group reported nearly daily interaction with natural environments at work.

    Key Insight: This profile showed the highest levels of vigor (+0.63) and dedication (+0.71), and the lowest levels of burnout.
    Need: To improve occupational well-being, workplaces could incorporate more accessible natural spaces (e.g., gardens, green rooftops) or promote structured activities like park walks during work breaks. Future research should explore how proximity, quality, and integration of nature at work influence restorative benefits.
Hyvönen et al. - 2018 - Profiles of nature exposure and outdoor activities, Idea",,"Profiles of Nature Exposure and Activities

    Five distinct profiles of nature exposure were identified:
        High Exposure (8%): Frequent exposure during both work and leisure time.

            Absorption: +0.43
        Participants in the High, Versatile, and Unilateral Exposure profiles had significantly higher engagement than those in the Low Exposure profile.

3. Burnout

    Frequent nature exposure during work and leisure was linked to lower burnout (cynicism and inadequacy):
        High Exposure Profile:
            Cynicism: -0.47
            Inadequacy: -0.40
        Participants in the Low Exposure profile reported the highest levels of burnout across all dimensions.

4. Diversity of Activities

    Activity diversity (e.g., engaging in varied activities such as walking, jogging, or gardening) did not significantly enhance well-being beyond frequent exposure.
    Participants with Versatile Exposure and Unilateral Exposure reported similar levels of work engagement, showing that frequency of exposure mattered more than diversity.

5. Nature Exposure at Work

    The High Exposure Profile, characterized by frequent workplace nature exposure, showed the most favorable well-being outcomes.
    Participants in this group were exposed to natural environments almost daily at work and had the lowest levels of burnout.

6. Impact of Low Exposure

    The Low Exposure Profile, representing 19% of participants, had the poorest well-being outcomes:

    Indoor and outdoor greenery were associated with fewer depressive symptoms during COVID-19 lockdowns.
    Digital nature, green window views, house plants, and community greenery quality had stronger effects in reducing depressive symptoms than other forms of greenery exposure.

Role of Restorativeness:

    Perceived restorativeness of the home environment mediated the relationship between greenery exposure and mental health.
    Restorativeness reduced loneliness and fear of COVID-19, which, in turn, lowered depressive symptoms.

Indoor Greenery:

    Digital nature exposure had a direct association with fewer depressive symptoms (β = -0.20, p < 0.01).
    Green window views showed strong indirect effects via loneliness and fear of COVID-19.
    Gardening activities were associated with depressive symptoms, but the relationship was not statistically significant.

Is virtual reality a valid tool for restorative environments research? (1),"Validity of Virtual Reality (VR) as a Tool for Restorative Environment Research
(1) Situation

The study seeks to establish whether VR can be a valid research tool for investigating the restorative qualities of natural and urban environments, comparing real-world exposure to similar experiences in virtual settings. The goal is to determine if VR elicits similar restorative effects, allowing it to be used as a reliable and controlled research method.
(2) Problem/Question

Can VR provide an experience comparable to real environments in terms of perceived restorative characteristics and outcomes like preference, pleasure, and restoration? If VR accurately simulates these experiences, it can become a cost-effective and flexible tool for environmental psychology research.
(3) Responses in the Paper

    Consistency of Outcomes Between Real and Virtual Environments:
        The study found that both real and virtual natural environments scored significantly higher on all measures (fascination, novelty, escape, and coherence) than their urban counterparts, supporting the idea that VR can replicate restorative experiences effectively.
        No significant differences were observed between the real and virtual butterfly gardens in terms of preference, pleasure, and restoration, indicating that VR can simulate the restorative benefits of real nature accurately.

    Predictive Validity of VR:
        The findings support that perceived restorative characteristics (fascination, novelty, escape, coherence) predict preference, pleasure, and restoration in both real and virtual settings. This alignment strengthens the argument for VR's validity as a research tool.
        Escape emerged as a key predictor across all settings, indicating that VR is particularly effective at simulating the ability to ""mentally get away,"" which is a critical component of restorative environments.

    Technological Fidelity and Presence:
        The use of the CAVE VR system with 3D visuals, head tracking, and environmental sounds enhances the sense of presence, contributing to VR's ability to mimic real-world experiences.
        The paper emphasizes the immersive quality of the VR experience, suggesting that elements like animation (e.g., butterflies) and auditory cues (e.g., bird sounds) were crucial for replicating the restorative environment effectively.

(4) Need for Different Approach

    Although the study demonstrates VR's validity, future research should investigate how individual differences in VR familiarity and comfort affect participants' experiences and outcomes. A standardized VR exposure protocol could control for this variability.
    Analyzing how longer exposure times in VR settings (e.g., extending beyond 20 minutes) might influence the validity of restorative outcomes, as compared to longer real-world exposure, could offer further insights into VR's effectiveness over time.

Is virtual reality a valid tool for restorative environments research? (2),"Method and Its Presentation in the Paper
(1) Situation

The paper aims to test the validity of VR as a tool for studying restorative environments by comparing real and virtual natural and urban settings. This is achieved through well-structured experimental designs (Study 1 with real environments and Study 2 with virtual environments), focusing on measuring the effect of these environments on mental restoration.
(2) Problem/Question

How effectively does the paper present its method to ensure clarity and reproducibility? Does the method adequately support the research question about the restorative qualities of natural and urban environments in both real and VR contexts?
(3) Responses in the Paper

    Clear Structure and Detail:
        The method section is thoroughly organized, describing each step from participant recruitment to the specific procedures followed in both studies.
        Participants and Design: The paper specifies the sample size, demographics, and how participants were exposed to each environment (counterbalanced, within-subjects design), providing transparency about the experimental design.
        Intervention and Setting: Detailed descriptions are given for the natural and urban environments in both real and virtual settings. For Study 1, participants experienced the real butterfly garden and shopping center for 50 minutes each. For Study 2, a CAVE VR system was employed, and participants explored virtual settings for 20 minutes.
        Fatigue Induction: Both studies use a 50-minute Sudoku task to induce mental fatigue before exposure to the environments, aiming to standardize the level of need for restoration across participants.

    Assessments and Measurements:
        The Perceived Restorative Characteristics Questionnaire (PRCQ) is used to measure fascination, novelty, escape, and coherence in both studies, with a consistent 7-point Likert scale.
        Preference, pleasure, and restoration outcomes are assessed through semantic differential items and self-reported emotional experiences, maintaining methodological consistency.

    Device and Technology Description:
        The paper clearly explains the VR setup, detailing how the CAVE system works (e.g., shutter glasses, head tracking, and joystick navigation) and how these contribute to participants' experience in the virtual environment.
        The authors make it clear that participants were asked to evaluate the virtual environment specifically and not the CAVE space itself.

(4) Need for Different Approach

    While the method is comprehensive, a more in-depth discussion on how the duration of exposure (50 minutes in real vs. 20 minutes in VR) might influence the findings would strengthen the methodology section.
    A breakdown of how participants' familiarity with VR technology could potentially impact the restorative experience would provide more context for the findings, especially in understanding the novelty factor.

This idea note underscores how the paper effectively presents its method, ensuring clarity, detail, and transparency in the design, procedure, and data collection processes. It also highlights potential areas for enhancement, such as equalizing intervention time and accounting for participant familiarity with VR technology, to better support the research's objectives.

Well-Defined Variables and Clear Hypotheses
(1) Situation

The paper sets out to test the effectiveness of VR in simulating restorative environments, examining whether virtual natural settings can produce similar restorative benefits as real-world counterparts. The focus is on comparing natural vs. urban environments using real and virtual settings.
(2) Problem/Question

The challenge is to identify whether VR can validly replicate real-world environments' restorative qualities and how specific characteristics (fascination, novelty, escape, coherence) influence preference, pleasure, and restoration in different environments.
(3) Responses in the Paper

    Independent Variables: Type of environment (natural vs. urban) and mode of exposure (real vs. virtual).
    Dependent Variables: Perceived restorative characteristics (fascination, novelty, escape, coherence) and self-reported outcomes related to the environment (preference, pleasure, and restoration).
    The use of the Perceived Restorative Characteristics Questionnaire (PRCQ) is precise, covering the characteristics that define a restorative environment and how they relate to experiences of preference, pleasure, and restoration.
    The paper provides clear hypotheses for both studies, predicting that natural environments will consistently score higher than urban settings in restorative qualities and that real and virtual environments will produce similar results when compared directly (i.e., real vs. virtual butterfly garden).

(4) Need for Different Approach

    To apply findings to workplace settings, future research could incorporate work-specific variables like productivity, fatigue, and job satisfaction, expanding beyond preference, pleasure, and restoration. This would help to directly link the restorative effects of environments to practical workplace outcomes.
    Conducting longitudinal assessments would provide a clearer understanding of the sustained impact of natural and virtual restorative environments on well-being and work performance over time.

This idea note highlights how the paper effectively defines its variables and hypotheses, setting a strong foundation for comparing real and virtual environments. A more nuanced approach targeting work-related outcomes could enhance the study's relevance to occupational health and productivity research.

        Participants experiencing a decrease or increase in working hours due to the pandemic had 2-3 times the risk of being Struggling or Floundering.

    Financial Stress and Mental Health:
        48% of participants reported high-to-overwhelming financial stress.
        Compared to those with no-to-low financial stress, participants with moderate financial stress were:
            1.5 times more likely to be Languishing.

    Emotional Exhaustion (EE):
        37% of EE variance was explained by the combined effect of organizational stressors and perceived percentage of nature views.
        Nurses with more organizational stress and less perceived nature exposure had significantly higher EE scores.
    Depersonalization (DP):
        43% of DP variance was explained by organizational stressors, environmental stressors, and perceived percentage of nature views.
        Higher organizational/environmental stress and lower nature views significantly increased DP.
    Personal Accomplishment (PA):
        No significant relationship was found between PA and any of the variables, including nature views.

Unit-Based Observations:

    Units with no nature views and no nature-themed artwork had the highest burnout levels (EE and DP).
    Units with nature views or nature-themed artwork showed lower burnout levels in comparison.

Role of Artwork:

    The presence of nature-themed artwork was weakly correlated with EE and DP but did not emerge as a significant predictor in the regression models.

Implications for Design:

    Nature views, even if limited, act as low-cost interventions to reduce burnout dimensions (EE and DP).

    Physical activity in natural surroundings during free time was significantly associated with greater vitality over one year.
    The standardized path coefficient (β) was 0.070 (p = 0.031), indicating that more frequent physical activity in nature predicts a noticeable increase in feelings of vitality over time.
    This relationship was observed after controlling for job-related factors (e.g., autonomy, workload, social support).

Marginal Association Between Yard Use and Happiness

    The use of one's garden or yard at home was marginally positively associated with increased happiness over time.
    The standardized coefficient was 0.076 (p = 0.061), suggesting a trend where more frequent use of a garden, balcony, or patio with natural elements might enhance happiness.

Lack of Significant Association Between Nature Exposure at Work and Well-being

    None of the variables involving exposure to nature at the workplace (such as having indoor plants, looking out the window, or having a nature view) showed a significant relationship with well-being outcomes (vitality, happiness, vigor, and creativity).
    This indicates that the type of exposure to nature matters, and active engagement in natural environments during free time might be more beneficial than passive exposure at work.

Reverse Causation: Creativity and Yard Use

    In a reverse relationship analysis, the sense of creativity at work (T1) predicted a more frequent use of one's yard or garden at home over time (T2).
    The path coefficient was 0.082 (p = 0.016), suggesting that those who feel creative are more likely to use their garden/yard frequently.
    Conversely, higher levels of vitality (T1) were linked to less frequent use of one's garden/yard over time, with a coefficient of -0.130 (p = 0.016).

    However, these effects were significantly mitigated by greenspace quality.

Greenspace Quality More Relevant than Quantity:

    Compared to greenspace quantity, quality metrics (e.g., maintenance, safety, naturalness) had a stronger and more consistent association with improved mental health outcomes.

    Mental health improvements from outdoor nature exposure were more pronounced in Bangladesh than in Egypt.
    The unexpected relationship between indoor plants and anxiety in Egypt highlights potential cultural or contextual differences in coping mechanisms.

5. Broader Implications:

    Spending time outdoors in green spaces can contribute significantly to mental health recovery, particularly in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) like Bangladesh.
    Indoor plants may reduce depression for some populations but could potentially increase anxiety in specific contexts.
    Urban greenness and access to green spaces may play a critical role in mental health resilience, particularly during global crises like COVID-19.

    Recruitment and Participation Strategy
        The study recruited participants via HR departments of three private and one public organization in the Netherlands. The participants were office workers who were working fully from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
        To encourage participation, direct emails were sent to employees by their respective HR departments, containing a link to the online survey.
        The final sample consisted of 1,219 respondents, who participated voluntarily, ensuring a large sample size that provides a broad understanding of experiences across different work environments and sectors.

    Survey Design and Questions
        Total Number of Questions: The survey contained questions about various aspects of workspace satisfaction, support for work activities, personal characteristics, and mental health variables.
            The questions were divided into sections that covered satisfaction with workspace characteristics (9 questions), satisfaction with support of work activities (4 questions), mental health variables (10 indicators with multiple items each), and personal characteristics (demographic and personality-related questions).
        Answering Format:
            Questions were mainly on Likert scales (e.g., 1-5 scale for satisfaction and 1-7 scale for concentration/fatigue), allowing participants to easily express the extent of their satisfaction or mental health status.
        The survey design likely emphasized simplicity and clarity, making it easier for participants to respond without feeling overwhelmed.

    Sustaining Engagement to Complete the Survey
        Time Commitment: The cross-sectional nature of the study and the structure of questions designed to be quick and straightforward might have made it more manageable for participants to complete.
        Personal Relevance: Given the context of COVID-19 and remote work, the questions addressed current and relevant experiences of the participants, which could have sustained their interest throughout the survey.
        Balanced Question Flow: The inclusion of a mix of topics (workspace satisfaction, work activity support, and personal well-being) kept the questionnaire engaging without focusing too long on any one subject, thereby reducing potential survey fatigue.

Overall, the strategy of direct HR emails, relevant and concise questions, and a well-structured survey flow helped maintain participant engagement, allowing them to complete all necessary questions and provide comprehensive data for the study.

Relationships in Workspace Satisfaction, Work Activities, and Mental Health

    Impact of Physical Workspace Characteristics on Mental Health and Work Activities
        Daylight, Views, and Privacy: The satisfaction with physical characteristics of the workspace-particularly daylight, views outside, and privacy-shows significant relationships with support for work activities and certain mental health variables.
            Daylight is positively related to the support of both online interactions (β = 0.29) and concentrated work (β = 0.13). It also indirectly affects concentration and hedonic tone.
            Privacy is significantly related to satisfaction with support for online interactions (β = 0.34) and indirectly to concentration and well-being through improved support for concentrated work.
            Views Outside enhances concentration (β = 0.25) and is linked to well-being and mood states.

    Interplay between Work Activity Support and Mental Health
        Support of Online Interactions and Concentrated Work: Satisfaction with the support for online interactions positively affects concentrated work (β = 0.75), indicating that the ability to effectively communicate online enhances focus and productivity.
            Support for concentrated work is related to higher concentration (β = 0.04) and overall well-being (β = 0.05).
        Mental health indicators such as disengagement are reduced when workers are more satisfied with support for online interactions (β = -0.09).

    Personal Characteristics and Mental Health Variables
        Neuroticism and Stress: Neuroticism shows a strong direct effect on stress (β = 0.48), which cascades into other mental health challenges like tense arousal (β = 0.66) and reduced hedonic tone (happiness/satisfaction).
        Conscientiousness positively affects concentration (β = 0.18) and indirectly relates to improved productivity and well-being.

    Mental Health Interdependencies and Their Cascade Effects
        Stress and Tense Arousal: A significant positive relationship is seen between stress and tense arousal (β = 0.66), which then negatively affects well-being and hedonic tone.
        Fatigue and Exhaustion: Fatigue (β = 0.43) leads to exhaustion, which contributes to disengagement from work and depressive symptoms.
        Concentration and Productivity: Higher concentration is linked to better productivity (β = 0.50), which further enhances well-being (β = 0.37).

Takeaways

    Key Variables: Daylight, privacy, views, and work activity support (online interactions and concentrated work) are crucial in shaping the mental health and productivity of workers.
    Direct and Indirect Relationships: Positive satisfaction with the home workspace's physical and support features translates into better concentration, reduced disengagement, and increased well-being, while negative traits like neuroticism and stress have cascading negative effects on mental health.
    Personalization Matters: Individual traits such as conscientiousness and neuroticism play a significant role in how workspace satisfaction affects mental health outcomes.

The path models highlight the multi-layered and interdependent nature of workspace satisfaction, mental health variables, and personal characteristics. Understanding these relationships can help tailor interventions for improving mental well-being and productivity in work-from-home environments.

    Public green areas (parks, accessible gardens) had limited effects on mental well-being in participants who had private gardens. Their impact was mediated by perceived quality rather than quantity.

Gender Differences:

    Women experienced more significant mental health benefits from high-quality streetscape greenery compared to men. This may be linked to gender-based differences in neighborhood usage patterns and perceptions of safety.

Engagement and Exposure:

    Frequent use of green spaces and engagement in gardening were not found to significantly mediate the relationship between greenery and well-being. However, visual contact (e.g., through window views) may have played an important role in influencing mental well-being.

Socio-Demographic Variables:

    Age, education, and nature connectedness did not significantly moderate the relationship between greenery characteristics and mental well-being.

Importance of Greenery Quality:

    Quality (e.g., maintenance, attractiveness, diversity) was more critical than quantity for well-being outcomes, both for private and streetscape greenery.",During COVID,Netherlands,Survey,521,NA,Mixed,NA,NA,Well Being,Positive or None,Subjective,NA,General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12),Observational (Quant),NA,0,"Characteristics of Greenery, Frequency of Contact, Gardening Activities",Mix,NA,Well being,Image
Short-Term Effects of Forest Therapy on Mood States: A Pilot Study,,https://chatgpt.com/g/g-MMN8j6CFo-systematic-reivew-gpt/c/673bc84d-807c-8003-aee9-673d4e120679,"Psychological Benefits of Forest Therapy

    Significant reductions in mood states:
        Anxiety: Reduced significantly in most forest sessions (notably FTS6 and FTS7).
        Anger: Most affected domain, significantly reduced in FTS3, FTS4, FTS6, and FTS7.
        Confusion: Moderately reduced, significant in FTS6 and FTS3, and near-significant in FTS4.
        Depression: Improved but less consistently across sessions compared to other mood states.

2. Comparison with Urban Park (Control) Session

    Forest therapy sessions in remote areas outperformed the control urban park session (FTSC) in reducing anxiety, anger, and confusion.
    No statistically significant changes were observed in the urban park session for any mood states.

3. Influence of Environmental Factors

    Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (BVOCs):
        Higher concentrations (measured as TVOCs) correlated with better psychological outcomes.
        Sessions with higher TVOC levels (e.g., FTS6 and FTS3) demonstrated stronger reductions in mood disturbances.
    Environmental Coherence:
        Sessions conducted in well-matched environmental settings (e.g., Mediterranean or humid forests) performed better.
        Presence of water features (streams or ponds) positively impacted outcomes in certain sessions.

4. Influence of Participant Characteristics

    Non-sporting participants:
        Showed the greatest reductions in anxiety, depression, and anger, suggesting significant benefits for individuals with less exposure to physical activity or nature.
    Age:
        Older participants experienced more substantial improvements, particularly in depression and confusion.
    Other demographics (gender, education, residence, etc.) had no significant influence.

5. Method of Conducting Sessions

    Professionally guided sessions were significantly more effective than unguided ones.
    Mindfulness-based practices (e.g., walking meditation, sensory immersion) enhanced psychological benefits.

6. Duration and Effectiveness

    Even a 3.5-hour single session was sufficient to produce measurable improvements in mood states.

Here are the key findings, supported by statistical outcomes:
1. Workplace Nature Features Enhance Quality of Life (QoL)

    Overall Impact: Higher exposure to nature features correlated with better QoL across all domains (physical, psychological, social, and environmental).
        Correlation Example: Higher scores in indoor nature scenes were associated with improved social relationships (r = 0.226, p = 0.002) and psychological health (r = 0.168, p = 0.021).

    Regression Analysis:
        Nature features (measured by the NAT questionnaire) were significant predictors of QoL, explaining 30.5% of the variance in overall QoL (F(13,155) = 5.23, p < 0.001).
        Specific predictors included the perceived mental health impact of COVID-19 (B = -0.65, 95% CI [-1.06 to -0.24]) and nature exposure (B = 0.04, 95% CI [0.02–0.06]).

2. Professional Quality of Life (ProQoL) Benefits from Nature Exposure

    Burnout:
        Higher exposure to nature features at the workplace was associated with lower levels of burnout (r = -0.283, p < 0.001).
        Indoor nature scenes (e.g., pictures) showed a specific negative correlation with burnout (r = -0.220, p = 0.002).

    Compassion Satisfaction:
        Positive association with exposure to nature features (r = 0.223, p = 0.003), particularly outdoor views and indoor plants.

    Regression Analysis:
        Nature exposure predicted burnout levels, explaining 36.5% of the variance (F(13,149) = 6.58, p < 0.001), alongside COVID-19 impacts on mental and professional life.

3. Indoor Nature Features Were Underrepresented

    Participant Perceptions:
        Indoor nature features, such as plants (mean score = 2.7/5) and nature scenes (mean score = 3.0/5), scored lower in availability compared to outdoor features like sunlight (mean score = 4.1/5).
        The lack of indoor nature features was highlighted as a gap in workplace design.

4. COVID-19's Amplified Stress Highlighted the Role of Nature

    Participants who reported higher perceived impacts of COVID-19 on their mental health also reported:
        Lower QoL.
        Higher burnout.
    However, access to nature features mitigated these negative effects, serving as a protective factor.

5. Distinctions Between Work Areas

    Urban workplaces had higher scores for outdoor nature features (e.g., sunlight), whereas rural workplaces tended to offer more diverse nature interactions.

Quantitative Highlights:

    Burnout Levels:
        Majority of participants reported low (52.4%) or moderate (43.5%) burnout.
        Only 1 participant (0.52%) reported high burnout.

    Forest Settings Showed the Best Physiological Recovery:
        Skin Conductance Level (SCL): Forest environments showed the most significant and prolonged reduction in SCL during the recovery phase (at minute 10).
        Comparative Effectiveness: Park environments (forest, lawn, waterside, plaza) were more effective in reducing physiological stress than greened streets, but there was no significant difference among the park settings at the end of the recovery phase.

    Perceived Stress Improved Across All Park Settings:
        Recovery Impact: All four park settings significantly reduced perceived stress compared to greened streets.
        Greened Streets Less Effective: Perceived stress levels remained higher for participants exposed to greened streets, compared to park settings.

2. Depressive Symptoms as Moderators:

    Individuals with Higher Depressive Symptoms Benefited More:
        In lawn settings, perceived stress decreased as depressive symptoms increased.
        For the other park settings, perceived stress remained stable regardless of depressive symptoms.
        Participants with more depressive symptoms reported higher stress levels in greened streets, indicating parks provide better recovery for this subgroup.

3. Gender Differences:

    Women Experienced Greater Stress Recovery:
        SCL Recovery: Women showed more significant physiological recovery (greater SCL declines) than men in all environments, including greened streets.
        Perceived Stress Reduction: Women reported larger reductions in perceived stress across park settings compared to men.

    Men Did Not Fully Recover in Greened Street Settings:
        SCL Recovery: Men's physiological stress (SCL) did not significantly decline in the greened street condition, and their perceived stress remained above baseline levels, unlike women.

4. Environmental Impact on Stress Recovery:

    Greened Streets Provided Limited Recovery Benefits:
        Although greened streets reduced stress, their effects were consistently weaker than those of park environments.

    Forest Settings Had the Longest Stress Recovery Effects:
        Forest environments demonstrated significant physiological recovery even in the second half of the 10-minute recovery period, suggesting a more lasting effect.

    No Differences Among Park Settings (Lawn, Plaza, Waterside, Forest):
        At the end of the recovery period, there were no significant differences in stress recovery between the park settings.

5. Methodological Insights:

    Self-Reported and Physiological Data Show Contrasts:
        While self-reported (perceived stress) data showed differences between greened streets and parks, physiological data (SCL) indicated subtle differences among park settings.

6. Practical Implications:

    Parks are Crucial for Stress Recovery:
        Park environments provide better restorative effects than greened streets, especially for individuals with higher depressive symptoms or chronic stress.
        Forests may be particularly beneficial for prolonged stress recovery.
    Gender-Specific Interventions May Be Needed:
        Women's greater recovery rates suggest they might benefit more from shorter exposure durations, while men may require longer exposure for similar recovery effects.",During COVID,China,Lab,123,Academia,Mixed,Artificial/Virtual,"Visual, Auditory",Stress,Positive or None,Mixed,Skin Conductance Level (SCL),"Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)",Experimental (Quant),NA,10,"Type of environment, Depressive Symptoms",NA,NA,Stress,Image

    Cortisol Reduction:
        Both desert and green VR environments significantly enhanced cortisol recovery compared to the office condition.
        Rate of cortisol decrease: Desert exposure had a slightly faster rate of cortisol recovery than the office, with a mean slope difference of -0.29 (95% CI: -0.55, -0.03).

    Comparison: The recovery effect of the desert was not significantly different from the green environment, suggesting both nature conditions were similarly effective for stress recovery.

2. Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP):

    Post-Trier Social Stress Test (TSST):
        MAP consistently decreased across all conditions, indicating recovery from the stressor.
        Desert condition: Demonstrated a more pronounced reduction in MAP compared to the office, with the difference approaching statistical significance (-2.71, 95% CI: -5.89, 0.47).
        Green condition: No significant difference in MAP recovery compared to the office.

3. Inflammatory Markers (IL-6 and IL-10):

    No significant differences in inflammatory responses (IL-6, IL-10, or IL-6/IL-10 ratios) were observed across the three conditions.

4. Preferences and Familiarity:

    Participants expressed a stronger preference for green environments over desert environments (mean scores: 3.42 vs. 2.48, respectively, on a 5-point scale).
    Impact of preference: Preference for desert landscapes was weakly associated with better cortisol recovery, but the effect was not statistically significant.

5. Key Insights:

    Unexpected Result: Contrary to evolutionary theories favoring green environments, desert environments had similar stress recovery effects, suggesting familiarity with the desert landscape may have moderated the results.
    Office Control: Participants recovered less effectively in the office condition compared to nature (desert or green), emphasizing the restorative effects of nature exposure.
    Theoretical Implications:
        Findings challenge the savanna hypothesis, which posits green environments are universally more restorative.

The Differential Impact of Mystery in Nature on Attention: An Oculometric Study,,https://chatgpt.com/g/g-MMN8j6CFo-systematic-reivew-gpt/c/675ff64d-51cc-8003-b340-6f34f49f7fe4,"High-Mystery Nature Images Engage Attention More Effectively:

    Pupil Dilation: High-mystery images caused significantly larger pupil dilations compared to low-mystery images (mean tonic pupil diameter: 3.14 mm vs. 3.11 mm; p < 0.001).
    Fixation Frequency: Participants made more frequent fixations on high-mystery images (15.93 fixations/image) than low-mystery images (15.45 fixations/image; p < 0.001).
    Blink Rate: Fewer eye blinks were observed during high-mystery trials (1.40 blinks/image) compared to low-mystery trials (1.52 blinks/image; p = 0.007).

Restoration Potential is Linked to Mystery:

    High-mystery images were rated as more fascinating (mean score: 2.82/6 vs. 2.36/6 for low-mystery; p < 0.001) and more aesthetically liked (mean score: 4.00/7 vs. 3.60/7; p < 0.001).
    These images engaged voluntary attention more effectively, suggesting enhanced restoration potential.

Challenging Attention Restoration Theory (ART):

    Contrary to ART's claim that voluntary attention ""rests"" during nature exposure, this study suggests that voluntary attention is actively engaged when viewing high-mystery nature settings, which may amplify restorative benefits.

Role of Luminance Controlled:

    While high-mystery images were darker (lower luminance), the relationship between mystery and attentional engagement remained significant even after statistically controlling for luminance.

Inverted-U Hypothesis for Engagement and Restoration:

    The study proposed an inverted-U relationship:
        Low attention engagement (e.g., low-mystery settings) may not be optimal for restoration.
        Moderate attention engagement (e.g., high-mystery settings) is likely ideal.

"The Effect of Police Officers' Gardening Activity Level, Plant Preferences, and Key Variables on Resilience","The Importance of Visual Aspects in Survey Design for Nature Exposure Studies
1. Situation:

The study used visual components in the survey to assess plant preferences, including flower cultivars and plant colors. Participants evaluated images of eight flower types (e.g., Tulipa spp., Narcissus spp.) and six colors (yellow, green, white, blue, orange, red). These visual aids allowed participants to make tangible connections between their psychological responses and specific plant features.
2. Problem/Question:

How does integrating visual stimuli in surveys enhance the validity and relevance of findings in studies on nature exposure and its psychological benefits?
3. Responses:

    Practical Relevance:
        Visual stimuli such as plant images ensure that participants can clearly understand and evaluate preferences, minimizing ambiguity compared to text-only questions.
        Preferences for yellow and green plants were associated with emotional benefits like ""brightness"" and ""relaxation,"" illustrating the importance of visual exposure in designing therapeutic environments.
    Emotional Connection:
        The survey captured nuanced emotional responses to plant colors using a Semantic Differential (SD) scale. For example, participants rated yellow plants as ""vibrant"" and ""comfortable,"" providing actionable insights for stress-relief interventions.
    Psychological Validity:
        The integration of visual elements aligns with previous findings that natural visuals (e.g., plant colors) evoke specific psychological responses such as reduced stress or enhanced calmness. This strengthens the ecological validity of the study.

4. Need:

Future studies should:

    Use immersive visual elements such as 3D images or virtual reality (VR) to replicate real-life interactions with nature.
    Extend visual assessments to include seasonal or environmental contexts (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor plants) to broaden application potential.
    Focus on culturally relevant visual stimuli to understand cross-cultural differences in plant preferences and psychological impacts.

This idea underscores the value of visual tools in enhancing survey engagement and generating actionable insights for nature-based psychological interventions.

    Positive correlations:
        Gardening activity level: Higher gardening activity was associated with greater resilience.
        Plant preferences: Officers who showed stronger preferences for certain plants (e.g., Tulipa spp., Narcissus spp.) and colors (e.g., yellow, green) exhibited higher resilience.
        Job satisfaction: Resilience increased with higher job satisfaction.
        Multidimensional calling: A strong sense of calling positively influenced resilience.
    Negative correlations:
        Stress level: Higher stress was significantly associated with lower resilience.
        Job burnout: Burnout, particularly emotional exhaustion and reduced professional efficacy, was strongly linked to reduced resilience.

2. Gardening Activities:

    Older officers (40–50 years), those with higher education, and those with longer work experience had higher gardening activity levels.
    Gardening activity level explained a small but significant portion of resilience variability (2%).

3. Plant and Color Preferences:

    Most preferred plants:
        Tulipa spp. (tulips) and Narcissus spp. (daffodils) were rated highest among eight flowering plant cultivars.
    Most preferred colors:
        Yellow and green plants were the most preferred, followed by white, blue, orange, and red.
        Emotional responses to yellow plants included feelings of ""brightness,"" ""warmth,"" and ""relaxation.""
        Red plants were least preferred, likely due to associations with wounds or blood in traumatic work environments.

4. Psychological Impacts:

    Job burnout:
        Was the strongest predictor of low resilience.
        Emotional exhaustion and reduced professional efficacy were significant contributors.
    Stress level:
        Contributed significantly to lower resilience.
        Stress explained 6% of the variation in resilience.
    Job satisfaction and income:
        Job satisfaction and moderate income (KRW 2.01–3 million) were positively associated with resilience.

5. Practical Implications:

    Using yellow and green plants (e.g., tulips, daffodils) in workplace gardens could promote positive emotions and enhance resilience.
    Promoting gardening activities and plant exposure in high-stress workplaces could be a valuable stress management strategy.

The effect of three different volumes of indoor greenery on employee well-being,"Defining Productivity and its Differentiation from Related Terms
1. Situation:

In the study, productivity is measured in two distinct ways: actual productivity (task performance via Sudoku scores) and perceived productivity (participants' self-reported sense of how productive they felt during the session). The study defines productivity as the effectiveness and efficiency with which participants complete cognitive tasks under varying environmental conditions (e.g., different greenery levels).
2. Understanding Productivity from the Study:

    Actual Productivity:
    Refers to objective performance metrics, such as the number of correct answers in a task (e.g., Sudoku).
        Focuses on measurable output over a fixed time (e.g., completing a task accurately within a 5-minute limit).
        Tied to cognitive capacity and environmental influences that affect task success (e.g., stress, focus).

    Perceived Productivity:
    Captures participants' subjective assessment of how productive they felt during the task.
        Measured via Likert-scale questions (e.g., how productive they perceived themselves to be under specific conditions).
        Influenced by psychological factors such as mood, satisfaction, and stress.

3. Differentiation Between Productivity and Related Terms:

    Efficiency:
        Refers to completing tasks using the least amount of resources (e.g., time, effort).
        While productivity measures output (e.g., Sudoku score), efficiency focuses on how resourceful or streamlined the process was.
        Example: A high Sudoku score (high productivity) completed with fewer errors or stress reflects high efficiency.

    Performance:
        A broader concept that includes not just productivity but also qualitative aspects of task execution, such as creativity, innovation, or adaptability.
        Productivity focuses narrowly on task output, while performance includes factors like initiative, problem-solving quality, or teamwork.

    Engagement:
        Refers to the level of interest, involvement, and motivation participants feel while completing tasks.
        Engagement affects perceived productivity but does not directly measure task output (e.g., someone may feel highly engaged but not achieve a high Sudoku score).

4. Insights for Future Research or Application:

    Productivity as a Dual Concept:
    The study's use of both objective productivity (task success) and subjective productivity (self-perception) highlights the importance of addressing both quantitative and psychological dimensions in productivity research.

    Distinguishing Productivity from Efficiency or Performance:
    Future studies should explicitly define what productivity entails and clarify whether the focus is on task output (productivity), the process (efficiency), or overall execution quality (performance).
        Example: In real workplaces, productivity may not equate to quality if tasks are rushed, highlighting the need for efficiency-focused or performance-based metrics in some contexts.

In conclusion, the study highlights productivity as a dual measure of task output and perception, distinguishing it from related terms like efficiency, performance, and engagement by its specific focus on measurable outcomes.

The effect of three different volumes of indoor greenery on employee well-being, Idea

Using Sudoku Tasks to Measure Productivity
1. Situation:

Sudoku puzzles were used as the primary task to measure participants' actual productivity in the study. Participants completed an easy-level Sudoku puzzle within a 5-minute time limit during each session, and their scores were recorded based on the number of correctly filled numbers. The task was designed to simulate cognitive demand while being straightforward and objective to score.
2. Why Sudoku Fits as a Productivity Measure:

    Objective and Quantifiable:
    Sudoku scores (number of correct entries) provide a clear, numeric measure of productivity. This eliminates subjectivity and allows for statistical comparison across conditions (e.g., greenery levels).

    Cognitive Complexity:
    Sudoku requires a combination of skills such as concentration, logical reasoning, and problem-solving, which are essential for many workplace tasks. These skills align closely with cognitive demands in real-life work scenarios.

    Standardization:
    Using pre-selected Sudoku puzzles with similar difficulty levels ensures that all participants face comparable tasks, maintaining consistency across sessions.
        The study accounted for potential difficulty discrepancies by using easy-level puzzles and verifying comparable challenges.

    Stress Simulation:
    By imposing a time constraint (5 minutes) and providing regular time reminders, the study replicated mild workplace stress conditions. This mirrors real-life situations where employees work under deadlines.

3. Insights for Future Research or Practical Use:

    Broader Application:
    Sudoku puzzles or similar tasks can serve as proxies for cognitive productivity in other experiments. They balance cognitive challenge and simplicity while being easy to replicate.

    Task Validity:
    The structured nature of Sudoku eliminates external factors like creativity or prior knowledge, making it a neutral productivity measure that avoids individual biases tied to specific skills (e.g., writing or technical expertise).

    Real-world Alignment:
    While it may not directly simulate all workplace tasks, the mental skills Sudoku requires (logical thinking, focus under pressure) reflect real-world productivity metrics.

The evaluation of the 3-30-300 green space rule and mental health," The 3-30-300 Rule and Its Impact on Mental Health

Situation:
The 3-30-300 rule, proposed for urban green space planning, recommends that every individual should:

    See at least three trees from their home.
    Reside in neighborhoods with at least 30% tree canopy cover.
    Live within 300 meters of a major green space.

Despite its appeal, evidence linking adherence to this rule with mental health outcomes remains scarce. This study evaluates the rule's components and their combined effects in a population-representative sample from Barcelona.

Problem or Question:
How effective is the 3-30-300 green space rule in improving mental health outcomes, and which of its components contribute the most?

Responses from the Study:

    Adherence Rates: Only 4.7% of participants met all three components of the rule, reflecting the scarcity of green space in urban Barcelona.
    Key Predictor: Residential greenness (NDVI ≥ 0.3), a proxy for 30% tree canopy cover, significantly reduced odds of poor mental health (OR = 0.60) and professional mental health visits (OR = 0.37).
    Mixed Evidence: Proximity to green space (<300m) and visibility of trees from home showed weaker or non-significant effects when analyzed independently.
    Combined Impact: Meeting the full 3-30-300 rule significantly reduced odds of combined psychiatrist or psychologist visits (OR = 0.31, CI: 0.11–0.91).

Need:
Future applications of the 3-30-300 rule should consider:

    Emphasizing quantitative measures of greenness (e.g., NDVI) over perceived proximity or visibility.
    Exploring longitudinal impacts in diverse cities with varying levels of tree canopy and green infrastructure.
    Integrating the rule into workplace design strategies, ensuring equitable access to green space for mental health benefits across professional settings.

    Income May Influence Depression:
        In the partially adjusted model, higher income levels were associated with lower PHQ-9 scores, but this relationship was not significant in the fully adjusted model.

    Greenness Perception is More Important Than Quantity:
        Satisfaction with greenness mattered more than the actual abundance of greenery in reducing depression.

"The Influence of Urban Gardening Activities on Participants' Perceived Restorativeness, Resilience, Sense of Community and Stress","Concrete Evidence of Psychological and Physiological Benefits from Urban Gardening

    Situation: The study provides concrete evidence demonstrating the benefits of urban gardening activities on mental and physiological well-being. Through the use of validated psychological scales and physiological measurements, the study was able to capture and quantify improvements in perceived restorativeness, resilience, sense of community, stress reduction, and stress biomarkers among participants.

    Problem or Question: The goal was to provide solid empirical evidence that participation in urban gardening activities could lead to measurable positive changes in psychological states and physiological stress markers. The study sought to determine not only if these interventions work but to what extent they improve specific psychological variables and reduce physiological stress.

    Responses to the Problem (Evidence and Methods):
        Use of Validated Psychological Scales:
            The Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS) showed increases in all sub-factors (repose, fascination, coherence, and legibility), indicating heightened perceptions of restorative experiences in participants.
            The Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) demonstrated significant improvements in hardiness, persistence, and optimism, showing that urban gardening activities enhanced participants' ability to cope with adversity.
            The Sense of Community Index (SCI) results highlighted improved integration and fulfillment of needs, membership, influence, and shared emotional connection, suggesting enhanced community bonds.
            The Brief Encounter Psychosocial Instrument (BEPSI) indicated a significant reduction in perceived stress among participants after engaging in the gardening activities.
        Physiological Evidence through Cortisol Measurement:
            Salivary Cortisol Levels were used as a biomarker for physiological stress. Experimental Group 1, which participated in gardening activities alone, showed a significant reduction in cortisol levels post-intervention (p = 0.001). This decrease provides a strong physiological indicator of reduced stress, confirming the psychological self-reports.
            The saliva samples were collected systematically (pre and post-session at regular intervals) to ensure accuracy and consistency in measuring cortisol changes.
        Experimental Design with Control Group: The study's pre-test–post-test control group design allowed for clear comparisons between those engaged in the intervention and those who did not participate. The significant differences in outcomes between the experimental groups and the control group provide strong causal evidence for the effectiveness of urban gardening in enhancing psychological well-being and reducing stress.

    Need: The use of both psychological scales and physiological markers provides robust, multi-dimensional evidence for the benefits of nature-based interventions like urban gardening. For practitioners or researchers looking to validate the effectiveness of similar interventions, combining subjective self-reports with objective biomarkers like cortisol levels can strengthen claims of psychological and physiological impact. Future studies can build upon this model to explore other potential benefits or variations in gardening activities.
The Influence of Urban Gardening Activities on Participants' Perceived Restorativeness, Resilience, Sense of Community and Stress, Idea


Grouping and Its Impact on Urban Gardening Intervention Outcomes

    Situation: 
The study investigated how different groupings influence the effectiveness of urban gardening interventions. Ninety participants were randomly assigned into three groups:
        Experimental Group 1: Engaged in gardening activities only.
        Experimental Group 2: Participated in gardening activities combined with forest healing therapy (e.g., sensory activities like meditation and flower tea therapy).
        Control Group: Did not participate in any gardening or therapeutic activities but continued their normal routines.

    Problem or Question: 
The purpose of grouping was to examine if adding sensory healing activities to gardening would enhance psychological and physiological benefits compared to gardening alone or no intervention. Specifically, the study aimed to determine which intervention (gardening alone vs. gardening with added therapy) would have a greater impact on perceived restorativeness, resilience, sense of community, stress reduction, and physiological stress (cortisol levels).

    Responses to the Problem:
        Experimental Group 1 vs. Group 2: Both groups showed improvement in perceived restorativeness, resilience, and sense of community, and a reduction in perceived stress. However, only Experimental Group 1 showed a significant reduction in cortisol levels, suggesting that gardening alone might be more effective for physiological stress reduction than the combined therapy.
        Control Group: Showed little to no change in psychological or physiological measures, indicating the impact of the interventions in the experimental groups.
        The findings suggest that grouping can significantly influence outcomes. Group 1's simpler intervention (gardening only) yielded notable physiological benefits (cortisol reduction), while Group 2 showed similar psychological improvements but without a significant physiological change. This may imply that additional therapeutic activities did not enhance the physiological benefit as expected, highlighting the need to carefully consider group interventions when designing studies for mental and physiological health.

    Need: 
Researchers should consider that simpler interventions like gardening alone may sometimes yield stronger physiological benefits compared to more complex combined interventions. Understanding how different group structures affect outcomes is crucial for designing effective programs for improving mental health and stress among workers or urban populations. Future studies could explore how varying the intensity or type of added interventions influences both psychological and physiological responses.

The relationship between natural outdoor environments and cognitive functioning and its mediators,,,"Cognitive Function and NOE Proximity:

    Proximity to NOE:
        A 100m increase in distance to NOE was associated with a 1.5% increase in CTT completion time (95% CI: 0.13, 2.89). Longer times reflect worse cognitive function.
        This suggests that living closer to NOE may enhance cognitive performance, particularly visual attention and effortful executive processing.

    Other NOE Metrics:
        Surrounding greenness (NDVI) and perceived NOE (e.g., neighborhood greenness or window views) did not show significant associations with cognitive function.
        Similarly, the frequency and duration of visits to NOE showed no clear impact on cognitive performance.

2. Mediators and Cognitive Function:

    None of the tested mediators (e.g., physical activity, social interaction, mental health, air pollution worries, noise annoyance) clearly explained the relationship between NOE proximity and cognitive function.
    Social Cohesion:
        Marginally significant as a mediator, but no robust evidence for its role in mediating the NOE-cognition relationship.

3. City-Specific Findings:

    The association between residential distance to NOE and cognitive function was strongest in Barcelona, the city with the largest sample size and the least NOE availability.
    The smaller impact in Doetinchem and Stoke-on-Trent may be due to higher baseline greenness levels in these cities.

4. Error Analysis in CTT:

    NOE exposure was not associated with CTT errors, which reflect impulse inhibition. This indicates that NOE may primarily influence attention rather than other cognitive aspects.

5. Null Findings and Implications:

2. Sick Leave and Return to Work (RTW):

    Reduction in Sick Leave:
        Total days with sick leave compensation decreased from 7204 (pre-NBR) to 3982 (12 months post-NBR).
        Many participants transitioned from full sick leave to rehabilitation benefits, facilitating gradual return to work.

    Rehabilitation Benefits:
        By the 12-month follow-up, 71% of participants were engaged in rehabilitation or work-training programs, a critical step toward RTW.

3. Healthcare Utilization:

    Reduction in Healthcare Visits:
        Mean healthcare visits dropped significantly:
            Baseline: 19.2 visits (6 months pre-NBR).

Using Structural Equation Modeling to Examine Pathways Between Environmental Characteristics and Perceived Restorativeness on Public Rooftop Gardens in China,"Structuring Pathways Between Environmental Characteristics and Restoration

Situation:
The researchers sought to explain the relationship between Public Rooftop Gardens' (PRGs) environmental characteristics and their restorative effects. To achieve this, they structured pathways involving three components: Perceived Sensory Dimensions (PSDs), Usage Patterns (UPs), and Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS).

Problem/Question:
How did the researchers design the pathway framework, and what methodologies were used to validate these relationships?

Responses to the Problem:

    Framework Design:
        Independent Variables (PSDs): Environmental characteristics like nature, serene, refuge, space, and social were selected as predictors of restoration.
        Mediating Variables (UPs): Usage patterns (e.g., retreat, family-bonding, interpersonal interaction) were hypothesized to mediate the relationship between PSDs and restorative outcomes.
        Dependent Variable (PRS): Restoration was measured using the Perceived Restorativeness Scale, which includes fascination, being away, compatibility, and coherence.

    Hypothesis Construction:
        The researchers hypothesized 20 theoretical pathways by combining five PSDs with four UPs, each leading to PRS as the outcome.
        Example Pathway: Nature → Retreat → Restoration hypothesized that natural elements encourage retreat, leading to psychological restoration.

    Survey as the Data Collection Method:
        Questionnaires assessed PSDs (e.g., spaciousness, calmness), UPs (e.g., nature-touching, family-bonding), and PRS (e.g., fascination, being away).
        A 7-point Likert scale was used, with higher scores indicating stronger perceptions or experiences.

    Statistical Validation:
        Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (EFA, CFA): Verified the validity and grouping of PSDs, UPs, and PRS dimensions.
        Multiple Linear Regression: Established which PSDs and UPs were significantly related to PRS.
        Structural Equation Modeling (SEM): Used to test and refine the pathways. SEM allowed:
            Introduction of latent variables (e.g., PSDs).
            Adjustment for measurement errors.
            Identification of significant path coefficients.

    Key Findings from Pathway Analysis:
        Of the 20 pathways, 14 were statistically significant.
        Example Results:
            Nature → Retreat → PRS: Valid, highlighting that natural elements encourage retreat, promoting restoration.
            Social → Family-Bonding → PRS: Valid, showing social spaces facilitate family activities, leading to restoration.
            Refuge → Nature-Touching → PRS: Not significant, suggesting refuge spaces may not strongly encourage direct engagement with nature.

Need:
This structured approach serves as a replicable model for future research on restorative environments. Researchers could expand the model by incorporating objective metrics (e.g., physiological stress measures) or additional mediators like demographics and external conditions (e.g., weather).

Family-Bonding as the Most Influential Mediator

Situation:
The study identified family-bonding activities as the most influential usage pattern, mediating the connection between PSDs (e.g., social, space, refuge) and restoration outcomes.

Problem/Question:
Why is family-bonding such a strong mediator, and what pathways does it support?

Responses to the Problem:

    Family-bonding activities significantly mediated the following pathways:
        Social → Family-Bonding → Restoration (Path coefficient: 0.159): Social spaces like paths and gathering spots encourage activities like playing with children or gardening.
        Space → Family-Bonding → Restoration (Path coefficient: 0.192): Open, flexible areas provide opportunities for shared family experiences.
        Refuge → Family-Bonding → Restoration (Path coefficient: 0.267): Sheltered, safe environments allow families to feel comfortable engaging in bonding activities.
    This finding underscores the role of social and physical environments in facilitating meaningful family interactions that lead to restoration.

Need:
Designers should create PRGs with features like child-friendly play zones, shaded areas, and interactive gardening spaces to maximize restorative benefits through family-bonding.

Space as the Most Versatile PSD

Situation:
Space emerged as a versatile PSD in the study, influencing restoration through multiple pathways. It offers flexibility for both individual and group activities in PRGs.

Problem/Question:
How does the dimension of space connect to various usage patterns to promote restoration?

Responses to the Problem:

    Space showed significant connections with four usage patterns:
        Family-Bonding (Path coefficient: 0.192): Spacious areas promote activities like playing with children or gardening.
        Interpersonal Interaction (Path coefficient: 0.211): Open, gathering-friendly spaces enable social connections.
        Retreat (Path coefficient: 0.223): Quiet, open areas allow for relaxation and meditation.
        Nature-Touching (Path coefficient: 0.185): Spatial variety enhances the experience of natural elements.
    These results highlight the comprehensive utility of space in fostering both social and solitary restorative experiences.

Need:
Future designs should prioritize creating spacious layouts that support multiple activities simultaneously, such as dedicated zones for social interaction and private retreat.

Pathways Linking Nature to Restoration

Situation:
Nature is a critical Perceived Sensory Dimension (PSD) that fosters psychological restoration in Public Rooftop Gardens (PRGs). The study tested how nature contributes to restoration through usage patterns.

Problem/Question:
What are the key pathways through which nature facilitates restoration, and how significant are these pathways?

Responses to the Problem:

    The study found that nature significantly contributes to restoration through three usage patterns:
        Retreat (Path coefficient: 0.176): Wild, untouched greenery encourages meditation, inspiration, and relaxation.
        Interpersonal Interaction (Path coefficient: 0.114): Nature creates a conducive environment for social connections.
        Nature-Touching (Path coefficient: 0.251): Activities like appreciating greenery or breathing fresh air directly enhance restorative experiences.
    The pathway Nature → Family-Bonding → Restoration was non-significant, suggesting that nature alone might not strongly facilitate family-based activities.

Need:
To optimize nature's role, designers could enhance features like lawns, trees, and natural settings to support retreat and individual reflection while considering how to better integrate family-friendly natural elements.

20 pathway to restoration tested : 

Perceived Sensory Dimensions (PSDs)

The study focused on 5 key PSDs (independent variables):

    Nature (e.g., wild, untouched spaces).
    Space (e.g., spacious, places for gathering).
    Social (e.g., entertainment, paths, general lighting).
    Refuge (e.g., sheltered spaces, sense of safety).
    Serene (e.g., peaceful and calm atmosphere).

2. Usage Patterns (UPs)

These were mediators that linked PSDs to restoration:

    Retreat (e.g., meditation, inspiration, lunch breaks).
    Family-Bonding Activities (e.g., playing with children, gardening).
    Interpersonal Interaction (e.g., chatting, gatherings).
    Nature-Touching (e.g., appreciating greenery, enjoying outdoor weather).

3. The 20 Pathways Tested

    Out of 20 theoretical pathways, 14 were significant, showing clear relationships between environmental characteristics (Perceived Sensory Dimensions, PSD), usage patterns (UP), and perceived restorativeness (PRS).
    Example pathways:
        Nature → Retreat → Restoration (Path coefficient: 0.176).
        Social → Family-Bonding → Restoration (Path coefficient: 0.159).

2. Most Influential Environmental Characteristics

    Social was the strongest predictor of restorative outcomes, followed by Serene, Refuge, Nature, and Space.
    Non-significant environmental characteristics included:
        Culture (e.g., fountains, statues).
        Prospect (e.g., open, well-maintained lawns).
        Rich in Species (e.g., biodiversity).

3. Most Effective Usage Patterns

    Family-Bonding Activities: The most influential mediator, facilitating restoration through social and space dimensions.
    Retreat: Strongly linked to serene and nature dimensions, fostering relaxation and meditation.
    Interpersonal Interaction: Enabled restoration via social and space dimensions.
    Nature-Touching: Played a moderate role in facilitating restoration.
    Non-Significant Usage Patterns: Exercise and sightseeing did not significantly contribute to restoration.

4. Role of Perceived Restorativeness (PRS)

    Among PRS dimensions, Fascination (e.g., the environment's ability to capture attention) was slightly more impactful than other dimensions like Being Away and Coherence.
    The restorative experience depends not just on environmental features but also on how users interact with the space.

5. Restorative Effects of Public Rooftop Gardens (PRGs)

    PRGs are effective in promoting psychological restoration through a combination of natural and social elements.
    They serve as valuable green spaces for temporary escape, relaxation, and social bonding, particularly in urban settings.

6. Practical Implications for Design

    PRGs should emphasize:
        Social spaces: Provide areas for gatherings and interactions.
        Serene settings: Ensure peaceful and safe spaces for retreat.
        Mixed-use functionality: Integrate greenery, spacious layouts, and diverse activity areas.",During COVID,China,Survey,876,NA,Mixed,NA,NA,Restoration,Positive or None,Subjective,NA,"Perceived Sensory Dimensions (PSD) Assessment, Usage Patterns (UP) Assessment, Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS)",Observational (Quant),NA,0,Perceived Sensory Dimensions,NA,NA,Restoration,Image

For clusters oriented toward natural elements, restoration scores were significantly high:
            POV 1 (main path bench): Restoration was 62.7% for cluster 3 (oriented toward the orchard), and 52.4% for cluster 6 (facing the RSA building).
            POV 2 (flowerbeds bench): Restoration was 64.4% for cluster 4 (facing the sensory garden), and 58% for cluster 2 (facing the RSA building with some natural elements).
            POV 3 (pergola): Restoration was 63.2% for cluster 1 (facing the children's playground).

    Emotional State:
        Most clusters reported positive emotions with moderate arousal, particularly in spaces with more natural elements:
            Cluster 1 (POV 3, pergola): The average emotional response was ""elated,"" with a pleasure score of 2.19 and an arousal score of 1.22.
            Cluster 4 (POV 2, flowerbeds): Pleasure was 2.28, the highest among all clusters, and arousal was 1.37.
            Cluster 5 (POV 1, urban-facing): This cluster reported the only negative emotional state with a pleasure score of 1.76 and the lowest arousal score of 1.17, representing a mild ""sad"" emotional state.

    Behavioral Tendencies:
        The types of activities participants felt inclined to engage in varied across different locations:
            In POV 2 (flowerbeds), 34.3% of participants engaged in interaction with nature, the highest among all clusters.
            In POV 1 (main path bench), 29.3% of participants engaged in social interactions, the highest for social engagement.
            In POV 3 (pergola), 37.3% of participants engaged in contemplative activities, the highest for this activity type.

Visually deficient working conditions and reduced work performance in office workers: Is it mediated by visual discomfort?,,https://chatgpt.com/g/g-MMN8j6CFo-systematic-reivew-gpt/c/66fbb93a-841c-8003-96c2-8e6f3886e3af,"Association Between Visual Ergonomics and Visual Performance:

    There was a significant relationship between perceived visual ergonomic working conditions and self-rated visual performance.
    Statistical Result: The model explained 30% of the variance in visual performance (r² = 0.30), with a standardized coefficient β = 0.327, and p < 0.01. This suggests that better visual ergonomics is associated with better visual performance.

Visual Discomfort as a Mediator:

    Visual discomfort was hypothesized to mediate the association between visual ergonomic conditions and visual performance, but this was not supported by the analysis.
    When visual discomfort was included as a mediator, the explained variance only slightly increased to r² = 0.32 (β = 0.315, p < 0.01), showing no significant mediation effect.
    The indirect effect of visual discomfort on visual performance was estimated as β = 0.056 (bootstrapped CI: -0.062 to 0.416), indicating that visual discomfort did not mediate the effect of visual ergonomics on performance.

Visual Discomfort & Performance Correlation:

    The correlation between visual discomfort and self-rated visual performance was significant but weaker than expected.
    The model explained 24% of the variance (r² = 0.232), with a standardized coefficient β = 0.122 (p > 0.05), indicating a modest association between discomfort and performance.

        Participants who viewed the nature video showed a statistically significant decrease in negative affect (PANAS NA scale).
            Mean reduction: 13.1 (T1) to 11.56 (T2).
        This indicates that even a 6-minute virtual nature video can reduce feelings of distress.

    Positive Affect:
        Positive affect remained stable in the nature group, while participants in the urban group experienced a significant decline.
            Urban video group mean: 30.63 (T1) to 26.92 (T2).
        High Sensory Processing Sensitivity (SPS) individuals exposed to the nature video experienced greater improvements in positive affect, showing that nature-based interventions are particularly beneficial for this group.

    Rumination:
        Rumination scores (BSRI) significantly decreased after both interventions (nature and urban videos).
            Nature group BSRI: Mean reduction from 212.8 to 152.98.
            Urban group BSRI: Mean reduction from 197.02 to 131.78.
        However, the urban video group experienced a concurrent decline in positive affect, suggesting that virtual nature is more restorative.

Cognitive Performance (Stroop Task)

    No significant changes in executive functioning (measured by Stroop reaction time difference) were observed for either intervention group.
        This result contrasts with previous findings in the literature and raises questions about the strength or duration of the intervention's effects on cognitive processing.

Role of Sensory Processing Sensitivity (SPS)

    Interaction Effect on Positive Affect:
        High-SPS participants benefited significantly more from nature exposure than urban exposure.
            Positive affect increased in the nature group for high-SPS individuals but decreased in the urban group.
        This suggests that high-SPS individuals are more responsive to restorative environments and more negatively affected by urban environments.

    No Enhanced Benefits for Rumination:
        Reductions in rumination occurred similarly across groups, indicating that both nature and urban videos occupied participants' attention enough to reduce ruminative thoughts.

Memories and Context

    Positive outcomes from the nature video were partly driven by memories evoked by the scenes (e.g., resembling places associated with positive emotions).

Watching Nature Videos Promotes Physiological Restoration: Evidence From the Modulation of Alpha Waves in Electroencephalography,"Significant Relaxation Effects of Nature Videos on EEG Alpha Waves

    Situation: Research on nature exposure often seeks to demonstrate physiological markers of relaxation, focusing on the effects of natural versus urban environments on brain activity, particularly through alpha waves in EEG.

    Problem/Question: Does exposure to nature in a virtual setting (nature videos) produce measurable physiological relaxation effects, as evidenced by specific changes in brain activity?

    Response to the Problem:
        The study found significant increases in early alpha wave power (8-11 Hz) in response to nature videos compared to urban and neutral scenes. Alpha waves are often linked with relaxed states, and the increase over the central and occipital brain regions suggests that nature videos can induce a physiological state similar to relaxation.
        Theta waves also increased, though less markedly, further suggesting enhanced cognitive control and relaxation during nature exposure.

    Need (Alternative Approach or Consideration):
        Further studies could explore longer or more immersive forms of nature exposure, such as multi-sensory VR or prolonged video sessions, to assess if these yield even stronger relaxation effects or broader cognitive restoration, potentially enhancing these findings for workplace stress reduction applications.

    Participants rated nature videos as the most relaxing compared to urban and neutral videos. There was a significant difference in relaxation scores, with nature scenes perceived as more calming.

EEG Results (Brain Activity):

    Increased Early Alpha Wave Activity (8-11 Hz): Nature videos led to a notable increase in early alpha wave power over the central and occipital brain regions, which is associated with relaxation and reduced attentional demand.
    Theta Waves (7-8 Hz): There was also a slight increase in theta wave activity over central brain areas when viewing nature scenes, which may indicate enhanced cognitive control and relaxation.
    Comparison to Other Conditions: The urban and neutral videos did not significantly enhance alpha or theta waves in the same way as nature scenes, suggesting that the calming effects were specific to natural environments.

Electrodermal Activity (EDA):

    Skin Conductance Responses (SCR): No significant differences in SCRs were found across the three video types, suggesting that moment-to-moment arousal was not markedly impacted by the different environments.

        Baseline findings: Tonic pupil diameter decreased over the baseline SART, suggesting reduced alertness during the task.
        Post-intervention findings: Pupil diameter showed a linear decrease across trials in the post-intervention SART, consistent with cognitive fatigue.
    Images did not modulate alertness.

3. Perceived Restorativeness (PRS):

    Nature images (Meadow and Ocean) were rated significantly higher for perceived restorativeness than the Urban image:
        Meadow and Ocean images: No significant differences between them; both were rated as equally restorative.
        Subscale highlights:
            Higher scores for Being Away and Coherence for nature images compared to the urban image.
            No differences between groups for the Fascination and Compatibility subscales.

4. Sleepiness (KSS):

    All participants reported increased sleepiness (via KSS) after completing the second SART, regardless of the image viewed.
    Viewing the images did not significantly reduce or increase sleepiness across groups.

Critical Insights:

    Mismatch between perception and performance:
        While nature images (Meadow, Ocean) were perceived as restorative, this did not translate into better sustained attention performance or physiological alertness.
    Nature vs. Urban:
        The Meadow and Ocean images consistently outperformed the Urban image in terms of perceived restoration but had no significant physiological or behavioral effects.
    Cognitive fatigue dominated:
        The prolonged nature of the SART task induced fatigue across all groups, likely overshadowing any potential restorative effects from the brief 40-second exposure.",Before COVID,Australia,Lab,68,NA,Mixed,Artificial/Virtual,Visual,"Response time, Restoration, Sleepiness, Physiological Alertness",Positive or None,Mixed,Eye-Tracking,"Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART), Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS), Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS)",Experimental (Quant),NA,0.67,"Response time (RTs), Physiological Alertness, Sleepiness, type of image",Office (In Field),NA,Restoration,Image
Water and Meadow Views Both Afford Perceived but Not Performance-Based Attention Restoration: Results From Two Experimental Studies_copy,,https://chatgpt.com/g/g-MMN8j6CFo-systematic-reivew-gpt/c/676a4ed0-d16c-8003-b420-13e189d4f7b0,"Sustained Attention Performance (SART):

    No significant differences in sustained attention performance were found between groups (Meadow, Ocean, Urban):
        Errors of commission: Similar across all groups.
        Response variability (sigma): Increased for all groups during the second half of the post-intervention SART, indicating cognitive fatigue.
    Viewing nature images (Meadow or Ocean) did not improve sustained attention compared to the Urban image, providing no support for Hypothesis 1.

2. Perceived Restorativeness (PRS):

    Nature images (Meadow and Ocean) were perceived as significantly more restorative than the Urban image:
        Overall PRS score: Meadow and Ocean images were rated similarly (p > 0.05), and both were significantly higher than Urban (p < 0.001).
        Subscale highlights:
            Being Away: Higher for nature images than Urban (p < 0.001).
            Fascination: Higher for nature images than Urban (p < 0.001).
            Coherence: Higher for nature images than Urban (p < 0.001).
            Compatibility: Higher for nature images than Urban (p < 0.001).

3. Connectedness to Nature (CNS):

    Moderating effect on perceived restoration:
        Participants with higher CNS scores (greater emotional connection to nature) rated the Meadow and Ocean images as significantly more restorative than those with lower CNS scores.
        No such interaction was found for the Urban image.
    No moderating effect on sustained attention performance:
        CNS scores did not influence participants' SART outcomes, irrespective of the image viewed.

4. Sleepiness (KSS):

    Participants reported an increase in sleepiness after completing the SART tasks, consistent across all groups.
    Viewing the images (nature or urban) had no significant effect on sleepiness reduction.

Key Insights:

    Discrepancy between perception and performance:
        Similar to Study 1, participants perceived nature images as restorative, but this did not translate into improved attention performance.
    Role of connectedness to nature:
        Connectedness to nature significantly influenced perceived restoration, highlighting the importance of personal traits in the restorative experience.
    Urban image's lower restorative value:
        The ground-level urban image was consistently rated as less restorative compared to the nature images, supporting Hypothesis 2.
    Cognitive fatigue dominates:
        The fast-paced nature of the SART task likely induced fatigue across all participants, possibly masking any subtle restorative effects from the brief 40-second exposure.",During COVID,Australia,Survey,186,Academia,Mixed,Artificial/Virtual,Visual,"Response time, Restoration, Sleepiness",Positive or None,Subjective,NA,"Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART), Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS), Connectedness to Nature Scale (CNS), Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS)",Mixed-Methods (Qual/Quant),NA,0.67,"Response time (RTs), Sleepiness, type of image, connectedness to nature",NA,NA,Restoration,Image
Well-being and multisensory urban parks at different ages: The role of interoception and audiovisual perception,,https://chatgpt.com/g/g-MMN8j6CFo-systematic-reivew-gpt/c/67649b94-32e8-8003-ba2e-3dbfb5302d7e,"Preferences for Urban Parks:

    Green parks with natural sounds (birdsong, water) were rated most positively by both young and elderly participants.
    Elderly participants preferred colorful parks over squares, showing a positive response to the visual stimulation provided by colors.
    Young participants gave higher importance to visual features, while elderly participants prioritized auditory features in their evaluations.

2. Impact of Auditory Stimuli:

    Birdsong was rated as the most pleasant sound across all scenarios, followed by water.
    Traffic and chatter sounds were rated as unpleasant, significantly lowering the emotional evaluations of parks, particularly for elderly participants.
    Elderly participants rated green parks with traffic noise significantly lower compared to young participants.

3. Age Differences in Evaluations:

    Young Participants:
        Rated green parks most positively, followed by colorful parks (only when paired with natural sounds).
        Showed a stronger reliance on visual features for positive evaluations.
    Elderly Participants:
        Rated both green and colorful parks positively but preferred colorful parks when paired with birdsong.
        Demonstrated greater sensitivity to auditory stimuli-natural sounds improved their ratings, while unpleasant sounds (like traffic) negatively impacted their evaluations.

4. Role of Interoceptive Awareness:

    For elderly participants:
        Higher interoceptive awareness (measured by the MAIA questionnaire) positively influenced their emotional evaluations of urban parks.
    Young participants showed no significant correlation between interoceptive awareness and their evaluations.

5. Cross-Modal Attention Performance:

    Elderly participants with better performance on the cross-modal attention task (i.e., integrating audio and visual stimuli) gave higher ratings to the audio-visual scenarios.
    For young participants, cross-modal attention performance did not significantly predict evaluations.

6. Interaction Between Visual and Auditory Features:

    The combination of natural sounds and green parks resulted in the highest emotional ratings for both groups.
    Elderly participants were more positively influenced by auditory cues, while young participants were influenced more by visual cues.
    Low-frequency sounds (like traffic noise) negatively impacted the elderly more than young participants, likely due to age-related auditory sensitivities.
